  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE RECEPTION AT BELFAST.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“Das vas Pelvast,” said Hans.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” nodded Frank, who was at the wheel of the
<i>White Wings</i>, “that is Belfast, ‘the home of fair women,
brave men and Strainer’s Sarsaparilla.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank Merriwell, the great Yale athlete, was cruising off
the Maine coast, during this vacation in his yacht, the
<i>White Wings</i>. He had with him four of his friends—Bart
Hodge, Bruce Browning, Jack Diamond and Hans
Dunnerwust.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you knew so much apout him?” asked the
Dutch boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, there it is in glaring letters on that big advertising
board that has been placed where it can be read
almost anywhere here in the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, I didn’t seen dot. I don’d vant no sarsbarillas,
und I don’d gif a cend vor der prafe men, but I don’d
mind if you took a look der peautiful girls at.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They say we shall see plenty of them here,” smiled
Merry. “Belfast is famous for them. No city of its size
in the State of Maine can compare with it for pretty girls
and beautiful women, if the report is true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot peen der madder mit Shack Ti’mond?” chuckled
Hans, calling attention to the Virginian. “He don’d seem
to took some interests dose peautiful girls in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Haw!” grunted Bruce Browning. “He is thinking
of the girl he left behind him—at Bar Harbor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, Baula Penjamin vos a beach,” admitted the
Dutch boy; “but there vos odders.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You make me weary, Hans,” said Jack, irritated. “If
you will close up a while I shall consider it a great
favor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t toldt you so!” squawked Dunnerwust. “You
vos tochy, dot’s vot is der madder mit me! You nefer
vos aple to took a shoke in my life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your jokes are rather dense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’d knew vot you meant py dot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t suppose you would.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boys were charmed with the view of Belfast obtained
from the water. The city is built on a slope, and
is embowered in trees, the houses and cottages showing
amid the green mass of foliage. Here and there could be
seen the tall spires of churches. The handsome residence
of the mayor on Northport Avenue could be plainly seen,
as it was situated in a sightly place overlooking the harbor
and the bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several vessels were on the stocks in the shipyards, and
the sound of hammering could be heard, while crews of
men were seen busily working about them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The harbor was filled with shipping. Lying at her
wharf, taking on freight and passengers, was the Boston
boat, <i>City of Bangor</i>, bound for the “Hub.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where will you anchor, Frank?” asked Bart Hodge,
approaching Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beyond the steamboat wharf where that fleet of small
boats and yachts are anchored.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clang-clang! clang-clang! The bell on the steamer suddenly
rang, and Frank knew what the signal meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is going to swing off from the wharf,” he said.
“It is high water, so I will hold inshore and let her go
outside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The steamer’s paddle wheels began to revolve, and she
swung round at the southern end of the wharf, straining
at the huge cable that held and turned her. It took
some time for her to turn, but a sudden toot from her
whistle told that at last she was ready to go ahead. Then
the cable was flung off and the great boat glided down
the harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>A stream of teams and human beings were leaving the
wharf and climbing the hill into the city, but on the wharf
remained a group of young men and boys, all dressed in
bicycle suits. They seemed to be watching the <i>White
Wings</i> with remarkable interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wonder why those cyclists are watching us?” said
Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was wondering about the same thing,” admitted
Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a youth was seen to climb on the piles at the
corner of the wharf. He stood up straight and cried:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ahoy, the yacht!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay! ay!” answered Frank, giving the wheel over to
Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that the <i>White Wings</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Those on the wharf could not see the name on the stern
of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Frank Merriwell in command?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to stop at Belfast?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then the Belfast Wheelmen will be honored to entertain
Mr. Merriwell while he remains in our city. Will he
be kind enough to come ashore as soon as possible? If
so, we will wait here for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Scott!” muttered Frank. “How did they know
I was coming? This is too much! They made it altogether
too interesting for me at Camden and Rockland,
and it begins to look as if there is to be a repetition of
it here. I’d rather not be known at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you can’t help it now,” said Hodge, who was
proud of Frank’s fame and popularity. “It won’t do to
refuse their polite offer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t refuse,” grunted Browning. “They’ll have
something good to eat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Py shimminy!” gurgled Hans. “Dot peen vot you
vant. I vos hungry enough to ead a raw tog alretty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The rest of us are not invited,” said Diamond, quickly.
“It’s only Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, maype he vould slip a piece of bie his bocket
indo uf he knew id vould safe my life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will Mr. Merriwell come ashore?” asked the spokesman
of the bicyclists.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say yes, Frank,” murmured Hodge. “Tell them you
will do so as soon as we drop anchor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank did so, and a cheer went up from the wheelmen
assembled on the wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this gathering were several girls in riding suits,
and other girls and young ladies watching, making it
evident that Frank and his friends had been expected.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>White Wings</i> swung in near to the other yachts
anchored in the harbor, her anchor went over and her
sails came down smoothly. Then Frank got into the
small boat, and Diamond and Hodge rowed him over to
the wharf where the cyclists awaited him. They gathered
around him as he came up the step onto the wharf, and
the one who had hailed the yacht grasped him by the
hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are Mr. Merriwell, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is my name,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Merriwell, I am delighted to know you. We are
all delighted. My name is Dustan—Howard Dustan.
These gentlemen are members of the Belfast Bicycle Club.
We heard you were coming. There was a Camden man
on the <i>City of Bangor</i>, which passed you on its way here
from Searsport, and he reported that you were headed
this way. It didn’t take long to get the boys together
when they learned that Frank Merriwell was coming in
here. Let me introduce them to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Frank was introduced to each of the lads in gray
as they came forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen,” he laughed, in his charming way, “I
assure you this is an unexpected pleasure. It will be a
long time before I shall forget my reception in Belfast. I
am glad to know you all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And we are glad you did not slight us by skipping
Belfast,” said Mart Woodock. “We heard you were in
Camden and Rockland, but, as you left there more than a
week ago, we thought you were not coming to Belfast.
You will find just as good people here as there are in the
State of Maine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” bowed Merry; “and I am
charmed with the people of Maine. It is my first visit
this way, but I am sure it will not be my last.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise and
sprang toward the door of the freighthouse.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>MERRIWELL MEETS HIS FOE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>All were surprised by Merriwell’s sudden move.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank had seen a person appear in the open door of
the freight house, look at him, and then dodge back. Although
he obtained but a glimpse of this person, Merry
fancied he knew him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the doorway he sprang, and looked around. On
every hand were boxes and barrels and piles of freight,
but no one was to be seen. The opposite door was standing
open.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Must have dodged out that way,” muttered Frank,
and he darted toward the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when he reached the door, he looked in vain for
the person he fancied he had seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My eyes may have fooled me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been followed by several of the cyclists, and they
were staring at him in amazement. He saw that he must
make some explanation, or they would think him deranged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right,” he laughed. “I fancied I saw a person
that I know. He appeared there in the doorway, and
then retreated into the building. I may have been mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have been,” said Mart Woodock.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come out and meet the girls,” said Howard Dustan.
“They are waiting to be introduced.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Merry was escorted into the presence of the girls
and introduced to each one in turn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had begun to believe you were not coming to
Belfast at all, Mr. Merriwell,” said a vivacious little
blond named Mabel Mitshef, but called “Mabel Mischief”
by her friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came near missing Belfast,” acknowledged Frank;
“but, after going to Bar Harbor, I learned something
about this place that made it seem very attractive to me,
and so I decided to come here. Already I am satisfied that
the stories I heard about Belfast are true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My!” cried Mabel. “You make me curious. I wonder
what stories you could have heard?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” smiled Frank, “I heard that Belfast had the
prettiest girls of any place on the Maine coast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This threw the girls into confusion, but Mabel had
sufficient presence of mind to say:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you came here because of those stories, I hope you
will not be disappointed, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the girls I have already seen fairly represent the
fair sex of Belfast, I am sure I shall not,” bowed Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank’s back was turned toward the freight house door,
so he did not see the hateful eyes which peered out at him.
The owner of those eyes drew back in a moment, muttering:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is Merriwell—curse him! I dodged him just
in time. He would have seen me if I hadn’t hidden amid
those boxes. He must not see me now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The speaker was Parker Flynn, who claimed to be the
rightful owner of the yacht, <i>White Wings</i>, and who had
made a desperate attempt to capture her by force in Rockland
harbor ten days before this story opens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn wore a bicycle suit, and he quickly stole out of
the freight house by another door, found a wheel outside,
mounted it and rode away swiftly.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime Frank was chatting with his new
friends, fascinating them by his wit and easy manners.
They had heard much of him, and not one of them was
disappointed in his appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Merriwell,” said Dustan, “I took care to bring
along a wheel for you when I heard you were coming into
the harbor. Of course, I took a chance about fitting you,
but I have the best wheel to be found in the city, and I
think it can be adjusted to suit you, if it is not right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I have my yachting suit on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind. I have trouser guards.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still I do not fancy riding this way. If I am to be
escorted into the city by the Belfast Wheelmen, I will
wear a riding suit. I have one on board, and can get into
it in fifteen minutes. Of course, I do not wish to keep
any of you waiting if you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right!” cried several.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go ahead and get your suit,” nodded Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond and Hodge had remained in the boat awaiting
orders from Merry, and now he hastily descended the
stairs and stepped into the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To the yacht,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Away they went, the two oarsmen pulling with such
grace and skill that they won the admiration of those
watching from the wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s up, Merry?” asked Jack, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Belfast Wheelmen are here to meet me, and they
are going to escort me into the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, how in the name of all things wonderful did
they know you were coming—for they must have known
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know the <i>City of Bangor</i> passed us just outside
the harbor as she was coming in on her way down river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, there was a Camden man on her, and he saw us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that the way of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. He recognized the <i>White Wings</i>, and, as soon
as the steamer reached the wharf, he told them we were
coming. Then there was a hasty gathering of the wheelmen
to meet us. That is how it came about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why are you going back to the yacht?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To get into a riding suit. They have a wheel for me,
and I am to ride up into the city with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say!” burst impulsively from Diamond, “these people
down this way are too much for me! I don’t understand
it! I thought we’d find a lot of farmers and woodsmen,
and I didn’t dream we’d ever run into anyone who had
heard of you, Merriwell. Instead of that, they seem
to know all about you, and they are ready to give you a
royal welcome wherever you go. Bar Harbor was the
only exception, and I will bet there are persons there who
know all about you. They didn’t know you were in town,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How about Green’s Landing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that’s different. That place is situated so far
from the mainland that——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It has regular steamboat connections with the mainland,
and the daily newspapers reach it, but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boat softly touched against the side of the yacht,
and Frank did not wait to say anything more. Over the
rail he went at a bound, and hurried down into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh?” grunted Browning, rising up from a bunk.
“Back so soon? What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To see if you are helping Hans get things trimmed
up,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am,” declared the lazy fellow, settling back comfortably.
“I am looking after things down below here, while
he attends to things on deck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank laughed. It was like the big fellow, who really
seemed too lazy to draw a breath without an effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>With skill that would have done credit to a “lightning
change artist” in a variety show, Frank got out of his
yachting suit and leaped into his bicycle suit. Then he
pulled on a Yale sweater, brushed his hair, caught up his
cap, and hurried on deck.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack and Bart were waiting. Frank did not hurry
after appearing on deck. With the utmost deliberation, he
looked around, gave some orders, and then walked to the
rail and got into the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arriving at the wharf, Dustan met him at the head of
the stairs, laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How you did it so quick I can’t tell, and still you
seemed in no particular hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went round to where the wheelmen and girls
were waiting. The bicycle brought for Frank was new
and a beauty. Merry tried it, and, to his surprise and
satisfaction, it seemed to fit him perfectly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It doesn’t need adjusting,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have a hard hill out here,” said Woodock. “Some
of us can’t climb it. There are but two girls in town
who can do it, and they are with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will ride with me at the head of the party,” said
Dustan, speaking to Frank. “Miss Mischief and Miss
Hazle will ride with us. They are the ones who can
climb the hill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I can’t climb it,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think there is no danger of your failing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They started. From choice it seemed Mabel Mischief
rode at Frank’s side, chatting with Hattie Hazle, who
was next to her. Hattie had dark eyes and hair, presenting
a strong contrast to the lively blonde.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hill proved to be rather steep and difficult, but
Frank and Dustan pedalled up it without permitting their
wheels to falter or sway on the steepest grade. The girls
found it more difficult, but they stuck to it persistently till
they accomplished the ascent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking back, it was found that more than half the
party was trundling the wheels, so those who had ridden
up dismounted and waited for the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the hill behind them, the party was formed again,
and then they rode along the elm-shaded streets into the
business portion of the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you ride about the city, or shall we go directly
to the club rooms?” asked Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would enjoy seeing something of the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will suit us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they rode about the place, and Frank was pleased
with its general appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last they arrived at the club rooms of the Belfast
Wheelmen, and there the girls left them, Mabel and
Hattie bidding Frank good-by, but expressing a hope that
they might see him again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan led the way into the club rooms, and Merry
followed. Just as Frank was entering, a person attempted
to come out hurriedly and brush past him.</p>

<p class='c010'>With an exclamation of satisfaction, Frank grasped
this individual, holding him fast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait a minute,” cried Merry. “I think I know you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leggo!” snarled the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a moment. Ha! I thought as much! I saw you
down at the wharf, but you dodged me. We have met
again, Mr. Parker Flynn!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a savage curse, the man struck straight at Frank’s
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan tried to catch Flynn’s arm, but was not quick
enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank dodged the fist of his foe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Blazes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn snarled out the word, trying to recover and strike
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you don’t!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a twist and a snap, Merriwell flung the desperate
fellow against the wall and held him there, despite all his
struggles.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Break away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mart Woodock tried to part them, but was prevented by
Dustan, who spoke swiftly and sharply:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let them alone! Merriwell knows what he is doing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But—but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He can handle Mr. Flynn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Flynn is our guest. We can’t see him misused.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no danger that I will misuse him, gentlemen,”
cut in Frank, still holding the fellow against the
wall. “I have not offered to give a blow in return for
his.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He attacked me—he assaulted me!” cried Flynn, in a
half whine. “I never did anything to him. I call on the
members of this club for protection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not need it, Flynn,” said Frank, “for you are
in no danger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then let me go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a minute. First, I want to tell these gentlemen
just who and what you are. I know you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I know you!” hissed the rascal, his face growing
dark. “You are a thief! You were arrested as a thief
in Rockland! You can’t deny it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was arrested——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hear that! hear that!” shouted Flynn, triumphantly.
“He confesses it! He owns that he was arrested!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was arrested on a warrant sworn out by you,” admitted
Frank, quietly. “I do confess that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps so. Why didn’t you stay and prosecute me?
Why did you take to your heels and fly from Rockland?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Business——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Business caused you to run away, eh? Tell the truth!
You knew I had sworn out a warrant against you, charging
you with an attempt to capture my yacht by force in
Rockland harbor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t care for that. It’s not your yacht. It’s mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed! Then why didn’t you remain in Rockland
and recover possession of it by legal means? You claimed
to have bought it of a man who is now in an insane asylum.
You fancied Benjamin, of whom I purchased it, was
on his way to Alaska. When you discovered that Benjamin
was in Rockland, you were so frightened that you
lost not a moment in running away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a lie! I didn’t care anything about Benjamin.
The <i>White Wings</i> belongs to me, and I will have her
sooner or later. I am not talking through my hat, either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you don’t let it alone, you will land in prison. I
shall not fool with you. I can push you now if I wish,
but I’ll be satisfied in exposing you. You have been a
guest here. It is plain you have had the freedom of the
club. I scarcely think you will be admitted in the future,
for I brand you as a rascal and a ruffian unfit for the
society of gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn turned crimson, and then he became ashen pale,
while his eyes gleamed redly and his features betrayed the
terrible fury that possessed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right!” he said, his voice being husky with anger.
“I’ll make you sorry for it. I have said all along that I
was not done with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The best thing you can do is to get out of Belfast
and this State in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’m not frightened!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may swear out another warrant against you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go ahead!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I do, I can shove you. I have witnesses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your own gang, and they will swear to anything you
want ’em to. Let go—let go, I say! Take your hands
off!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Steady!” and Frank again pinned him against the
wall, despite his struggles, holding the man with an ease
that astonished the witnesses. “I will let you go when I
am ready—not before. I am not done talking to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn’s anger was terrible to see. His eyes glared and
he actually frothed at the mouth. At that moment he
looked as if he longed to annihilate Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fellow stopped struggling, but suddenly he drew
something from beneath his coat—something that flashed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out, Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Woodock tried to catch hold of the fellow, but
Flynn struck at Frank with that bright thing, and Merriwell
dropped to the floor, with a gasping exclamation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s stabbed!” shouted Dustan, horrified.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clang!</p>

<p class='c010'>The knife fell from Flynn’s hand to the floor. The
ruffian stared down at Frank a moment, and then he
whirled toward the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Howard Dustan shouted the words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t try it!” grated Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the spectators did try it, however.</p>

<p class='c010'>Out shot Flynn’s fist. Smack!—it struck the fellow
fairly in the mouth, knocking him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>The desperate rascal leaped over the one he had struck
down and was outside in a moment. His wheel was there.
Onto it he leaped, his feet found the pedals, and he shot
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s killed Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—think—not,” gasped Frank, speaking with difficulty.
“He’s simply—knocked the wind—out of—me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he sat up, with his hands pressed to the pit of
his stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, he stabbed you there!” exclaimed Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t think so,” said Merriwell, with a rueful smile.
“He came near it. Belt buckle turned knife. He meant
to do it, all right. Took me by surprise. I was to blame.
Wasn’t on guard. Blow knocked wind out of me—that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank Heaven for that! I thought he had done you
up. But he meant to, and that was a crime! After him,
fellows! Don’t let him get away! Thomaston prison is
good enough for him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Already two or three had rushed out and started in hot
pursuit of the fugitive, raising an outcry on the street.
They soon disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell arose, looking thoroughly disgusted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was not smart, or he’d not taken me by surprise like
that. Wasn’t looking for that kind of a blow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can thank fortune he didn’t murder you,” said
Dustan. “Why, I never saw anything like it! He struck
like a snake!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a snake. It surprised me to find him here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t blame us. He had papers that showed he belonged
to two of the leading cycling clubs of Boston. He
is a smooth talker, and he literally talked his way in here.
Woodock seemed to take to him, for some reason, and
they were friendly. He is pursuing him now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Mr. Flynn left something behind to remember
him by,” smiled Frank, picking up the knife. “I believe
I will keep this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us everything about your trouble with him, if you
really were not harmed by that knife,” urged one of the
wheelmen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Examination showed a dent in the buckle of Frank’s
belt, but his clothes were not cut and he was entirely uninjured,
although, as yet, he had not fully recovered his
wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he could talk with ease, Merry told how he had
seen Flynn the first time shortly after taking possession of
the <i>White Wings</i> in Boston, how Flynn had showed a
bill of sale for the yacht, made out to him by Fergus
Fearson, a former owner, and how the encounter had
ended in the discomfiture of Flynn, as Frank had proved
the bill of sale was dated nearly ten days after Fearson
sold the yacht to Jack Benjamin, of whom Merriwell
purchased it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn had sworn to have the yacht, and, as the <i>White
Wings</i> was entering Rockland harbor one foggy morning,
several days after the encounter in Boston, the claimant
and some fellow rascals had tried to take possession of her
by force, one of the gang pretending to be Sheriff Ulmer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank had not been fooled, and he demanded to see
their authority. As they could show none, they were
warned not to attempt to board the <i>White Wings</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>They did attempt it, however, but were repulsed by
Frank and his friends and forced to retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came the arrest of Frank on his appearance in
Rockland, but Flynn had discovered the presence of
Benjamin in the Limerock City, and then he had not
stopped to prosecute, but had quickly and discreetly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys will catch him,” said Dustan, with confidence.
“You can put him behind the bars, Mr. Merriwell,
and you must do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But, to the surprise of all, the pursuers returned after a
time, coming back in a body, and announced that the fellow
had given them the slip. He had ridden like the wind,
turning corner after corner, and they had followed as
hotly as they could. At last they came up with a rider
they believed their man, but found it was another person.
In some way he had dodged them after turning a corner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan looked angry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was beastly luck!” he exclaimed. “But we’ll
catch the fellow, Mr. Merriwell, I promise you that. He
assaulted you here in our rooms, and we shall feel it our
duty to see that he is arrested. Come with me, and I
will take you where you can swear out a warrant against
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not fancy that will do any good,” said Frank.
“He thinks he stabbed me, and he will not stop till he has
left Belfast far behind. You’ll not see him around here
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right,” nodded Dustan; “but we can put an
officer on the track of him. We’ll run him down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t worth while, for it will cause me a large amount
of trouble. I shall have to appear against him and testify,
and I do not wish to take the time for that. He will not
trouble me again, so I will let him go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s your affair,” said Dustan, “so you may do as you
like, but no person can try to stab me and get off so
easy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time it was known on the street that an encounter
had taken place between two guests of the wheelmen,
and the report that one of them had tried to stab the
other was enough to provide a fertile topic for conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when it was known that the one murderously assaulted
was Frank Merriwell, the famous star twirler of
the Yale baseball team, the tongue of gossip wagged
freely.</p>

<p class='c010'>A crowd gathered in front of the building in which the
club rooms were located. The greater part of the crowd
were boys and young men, and their conversation showed
that every one had heard of Merriwell and all were eager
to see him.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the club members came in after passing through
the crowd, and he was laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was not aware you were so well known in Belfast,
Mr. Merriwell,” he said. “Those youngsters out there
are wild to get a peep at you. I just heard one of them
say you were a bigger man than the President of the
United States.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank blushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed. “If this thing keeps up, I’ll
have to travel through Maine in disguise. Had to get out
of Camden because I was too well known.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are talking about your famous double shoot. I
wonder how that story started.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What story?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, the story about that double curve. Of course,
there may be an out drop, or something like that—in fact,
we know there is such a thing. But a double curve that
consists of an in and an out is an utter impossibility.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why an impossibility?” smiled Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because there is no scientific explanation of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no scientific explanation of any shoot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that? Why, it can’t be that you mean to tell
me that, Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Wallace is an authority around here on baseball,
Mr. Merriwell,” said Howard Dustan, quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank bowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you claim to explain the science of shoots and
curves, Mr. Wallace?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, it is simple enough,” assured Wallace, boldly.
“What astonishes me is to hear a college man like you,
reputed to be a great pitcher, declare there is no scientific
explanation of shoots.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think I should be able to explain them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not. What is more, never yet have I met a
pitcher who could. I have met several who have tried it,
but they tripped themselves and showed their own ignorance
before they had finished. If you can explain
shoots, I shall be very pleased to listen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, it seems easy enough. If a ball leaves the
pitcher’s hand so that it is whirling swiftly, the resistance
of the air is bound to cause it to deviate from a straight
course. I should think anyone might understand that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That seems simple enough,” confessed Frank, still
smiling. “It might seem to explain the ball that curves
gradually and regularly, but it does not explain any shoot.
If you have followed baseball closely, Mr. Wallace, you
have thousands of times seen balls which left the pitcher’s
hand and seemed to shoot straight ahead for more than
two-thirds of the distance to the batter. Then you have
seen them give a sudden jump or shoot to one side or the
other. Indeed, some of these shoots are so sudden that
the ball almost seems to make an angle in the air, instead
of a curve. I am afraid you will find it difficult to apply
your explanation to that kind of a ball.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace looked somewhat bewildered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not thought much on that point,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have,” said Frank, “and so have thousands of intelligent
persons. Thus far not one of them can give a satisfactory
explanation of the odd shoots of a ball. They say
it is the way the pitcher takes hold of the ball—the way
it leaves his hand. That is true. But it frequently occurs
that two pitchers take hold of the ball in a manner entirely
dissimilar to throw the same curve. They do not deliver
it in the same manner, and yet the ball curves the same.
They know that by taking hold of it just so and throwing
it with just such speed they can obtain a certain curve;
but ask them to explain why the ball curves and you will
see some very puzzled gentlemen. You say the whirling
motion of the ball, resistance of the air, and so forth. It
may be you are right, but explain the shoot. Photographers
have tried to catch it so they could see just how it
curves in the air. Thus far these attempts have not proved
satisfactory. Fame awaits the man who first explains the
shoot and makes his explanation convincing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The club members had gathered around to hear what
Merriwell was saying. They were greatly interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still,” said Wallace, “you would not have us believe
that, on one delivery, a ball can commence to curve one
way and then reverse and curve the other?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, sir, I am indifferent whether you believe it or
not. I know such a thing happens. I know that I can
throw the double shoot when I am in good condition and
feeling just right. I know I take hold of it in a certain
manner, give my arm a certain swing, and my wrist a snap.
The ball starts out straight, shoots one way and then reverses
and shoots the other. I am not the only one who
can pitch that ball. I first saw it pitched by a Maine man,
Billy Maines, of Windham. Then I set about trying to get
it, and, by the merest accident, I hit upon it. I have tried
to show other good pitchers how to throw it, but they are
not persistent enough—they get discouraged after a while
and give it up. But there is something more wonderful
than the in and out double shoot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can it be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A rise with a drop on the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What? You don’t mean to say anybody can pitch a
ball like that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe there is a man in the National League that
claims to do it. Those who have seen him work say he
really does pitch such a ball.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Impossible! The only drop it can have is the one
given it by natural gravitation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it seems that way, but they say his ball rises
steadily after leaving his hand till it is more than two-thirds
of the distance to the batter, and then takes a most
remarkable down shoot. It is said to be a wicked ball
to hit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said Wallace, “I shall take no stock in such
yarns till I am convinced by the evidence of my own eyes—and
then I don’t know as I could believe it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is plain that you are prejudiced, and any man will
waste his time who tries to convince you. There are hundreds
of people in the country to-day who will not believe
it possible to throw any kind of a curve. Some of them
will not be convinced. They are not worth wasting time
upon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With that Frank turned away. Wallace paled and
pressed his lips together, for he felt that Merriwell’s final
words were a thrust at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mart Woodock slipped up to Wallace and muttered in
his ear:</p>

<p class='c010'>“That fellow thinks he knows it all. He makes me
sick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’m not stuck on him myself,” sulked Wallace.
“I do not fancy being given even a mild calling down by
such a chap as he.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they drew aside by themselves and talked in low
tones.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>BACK TO THE YACHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>If Frank had accepted, he and his friends would have
been taken care of at the best hotel at Belfast without
finding it necessary to pay a cent for accommodations.
The Belfast Wheelmen assured him that the city was his.
He could take what he wanted, and they would settle the
bill.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Frank explained that the accommodations on board
the <i>White Wings</i> were sufficient and he preferred staying
on board, as he could watch his yacht. He did not wish
to take chances of losing it, and it was possible Flynn
might make another desperate attempt to take it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was invited to accompany the club on an evening
run to Northport, and accepted. They told him to bring
along any of his friends who wished to go, saying wheels
would be furnished for all.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he left the club he was forced to pass through the
throng outside the door. As he appeared, a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There he is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there was considerable pushing, and a small
boy shouted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hooray fer Frank Merriwell! He’s a jim-hickey!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A yell went up from the boys.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank laughed and bowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t ye come down here to live?” piped a little
fellow. “Then Belfast could git inter the league an’ beat
anything on top of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clear out, you young rascals!” cried Howard Dustan.
“Don’t you know better than to block the way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He started to drive them back, but Frank quickly interfered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, Dustan,” he said. “They are not in
my way. Let them alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s him!” shrilled a youngster with a freckled face.
“That’s jest like Frank Merriwell. He don’t never try
ter crowd nobody off’n the earth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank passed through the crowd, and, accompanied by
Dustan, walked along the main street. It did not seem so
remarkable that the town of Camden had given him so
much attention, but he was surprised when he found himself
regarded with equal interest in Belfast. Men turned
to look at him, and pretty girls gave him curious and admiring
glances as they passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they turned from the main street toward the steamboat
wharf, Dustan said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here is the Windsor Hotel. We will meet here this
evening at seven o’clock for the run down to Northport.
It is not far, but we can spend a pleasant evening at
Northport and start back by ten o’clock. Bring any of
your friends who wish to come. We’ll try to make it
pleasant for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank expressed his thanks and promised to be on hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan walked all the way to the wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond was watching for Merry, and saw him descending
the hill. Then he got Hodge into the boat, and
they were at the wharf waiting for Frank when he arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank introduced Dustan, who was urged to go off to
the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t do so this afternoon, gentlemen,” said Howard;
“but I’ll be pleased to do so to-morrow. I’ve got to go
home and get ready for this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, shaking hands with Merry, he turned and hastened
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How does Belfast strike you, Merry?” asked Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a great town as far as hospitality goes. Why,
the Belfast Wheelmen wanted to lodge us at the best hotel
in the city and pay all of our bills while we remained.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t tell Hans,” said Hodge. “He will have a fit if
you don’t accept.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hans was on deck, and he hailed them before they
reached the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you got dot biece uf bie, Vrankie?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What piece of pie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, der von I toldt you to put your bocket indo.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t seen any pie, and I am back here to be fed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shimminy Gristmas! vot vos der madder mit you,
ain’d id?” squawked the Dutch boy. “You don’d vant to
ate der crub vot vos on poard this yocht uf ven you can
got a sqvare meal der shore on, do I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You didn’t suppose I would eat on shore and leave you
here to wear your teeth out on canned stuff and hard bread,
did you? Well, I am not that kind of a chap. What is
good enough for you is good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Py shimminy! I nefer looked at heem dot vay in
pefore. You peen all righd, Vrankie, und I abbreciate
your thoughtfulness-ness us of. Subber vill peen retty as
soon as I can got id.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hans hurried below.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is satisfied now,” said Hodge. “You fixed him
all right, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The water of the harbor was as smooth as glass, for the
afternoon breeze had died out with the declining of the sun.
The deck awning had been erected on the yacht while
Frank was absent, and Hans brought up the folding table
and spread it beneath the awning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning was in his bunk, sleeping like a log. When
he was aroused by Merry, he grunted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you were going ashore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been ashore.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, why didn’t you stay a while?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I stayed more than two hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hey? What sort of a jolly are you giving me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No jolly at all. Turn out. You have been sleeping
like a pig. I did think you were about as lazy as you
could be before we started on this cruise, but you are
getting worse and worse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning rolled out of his bunk and sat up rubbing his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>It did not take Hans long to get supper ready, and they
gathered about the table. As they ate, Frank told them
of his adventure with Flynn. Diamond began to get excited
as he listened, and he uttered a cry of rage when
Frank told how the fellow tried to stab him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, Merriwell!” said the Virginian, hotly,
“what are you going to do about this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t do much,” said Frank. Then he told how
Flynn took to his bicycle and got away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you let him go?” boiled Diamond. “If any man
had done such a trick to me, I’d pursued him round the
world, but I’d given him his deserts!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t doubt it,” smiled Frank. “If they had brought
Flynn back, he’d been shoved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not shove him anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I might, but it would make no end of trouble, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind the trouble. Give it to the whelp!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it will spoil our trip down this way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be forced to spend some time in pursuing the
rascal, and, after he is caught, it will be necessary to have
him tried. It will make no end of trouble and expense,
and, by the time it’s all over, a good share of the time we
have left during this vacation will be used up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind,” said Jack. “We can stand it. Shove
him, Merry. It takes considerable time to arouse you,
but you are a bad man when you get started. Now is the
time to get started. Don’t you think so, fellows?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, what’s the use to go to all that trouble?” said
Bruce. “It won’t pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Virginian gave the big fellow a look of scorn,
started to say something, cut himself short, and began
eating in a manner that showed his disgust.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank told of the general invitation to accompany the
wheelmen on the run to Northport.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who wishes to go?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge and Diamond expressed a desire to do so, while
Hans said he would remain and look out for the yacht.
Browning said he would stay with Hans.</p>

<p class='c010'>After supper they lounged under the awning a while,
and Browning, who had taken up smoking again, lighted
a cigar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to see that isn’t a cigarette,” said Frank.
“If you must smoke, smoke anything but cigarettes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was past six when Hans set Frank, Jack and Bart
ashore and then rowed back to the yacht, under the awning
of which Bruce still lounged, apparently fully contented.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trio walked up the street and arrived at the Windsor
ahead of time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Harold Dustan was waiting for them, and he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your wheel is ready for you, Mr. Merriwell. Will
your friends go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, they thought they would enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will telephone to Woodock to bring two good
wheels for them. No trouble at all. I made arrangements
to provide five wheels, if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went into the hotel and telephoned for the wheels.
Fifteen minutes later Woodock and Wallace arrived with
the extra wheels, which Hodge and Diamond immediately
adjusted to suit them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wheelmen gathered swiftly when seven o’clock arrived,
and a few minutes after the hour struck the party
started from in front of the hotel, with Dustan, Merriwell,
Diamond and Hodge leading.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed that all the boys of the city were on hand to
watch them start, and the youngsters set up a great yelling
as they rode away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along the pleasant street they pedaled in the cool
shadows of the tall trees. Handsome residences were to
be seen on either hand, and Diamond found a novelty in
mentally contrasting them with the houses of the South.
To him, despite the fact that the Northern houses were
tasty and pleasant, there was something about a Southern
dwelling that satisfied him far better. Had he been asked
to tell just what that something was, he could not have
done so, but he felt it was a certain distinctive air that
belonged to the South. For a moment something like a
strong feeling of homesickness swept over him. He remembered
how little time he had spent at home since
entering college, and a sense of guilt settled upon him.
To himself he seemed half a traitor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am a Southerner still!” he mentally exclaimed.
“Nothing can wean my heart from the South. The North
is smart and bustling and pleasant, but it is not like my
dear Virginia home. No matter where I may go, I know
my heart will always turn back to Old Virginny.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At length they came to the forks of the road where
Northport Avenue began. Just as they reached the fountain
at the forks, down from the other street came eight
young lady cyclists, merrily ringing their bells. The boys
answered in a similar manner as the young ladies approached.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan explained that they were friends of the club
members, and they were chaperoned by a young married
woman whose husband belonged to the wheelmen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel Mischief and Hattie Hazle were with the party.
They bowed to Frank. A flush came into Bart’s cheeks
as his eyes rested on Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jove!” he muttered. “What a stunning girl!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which one?” asked Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The one with light hair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep away! I met her first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I haven’t a show,” came ruefully from Bart. “I
don’t suppose you will introduce a fellow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, did I ever refuse anything of the kind? When
the opportunity comes, I will introduce you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart watched for the opportunity. He saw Mabel and
Hattie racing for the lead, laughing as they did so.
Hattie won, and Mabel stopped trying, so that Frank soon
was at her side. Then Bart pushed forward so that he
was abreast of them and coughed. Frank took the hint,
and the desired introduction followed. Bart lifted his cap
gracefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>Walter Wallace had kept his eyes on Mabel, and he
muttered something under his breath as he saw the introduction.
Then he pushed forward and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Miss Mischief,” said Wallace. “I
thought you said you could not come with us to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did,” she answered, laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But here you are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother decided to let me come when she knew Mrs.
Porter would be with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me that your mother is very particular.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is. Excuse me. Mr. Hodge was speaking to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hang Mr. Hodge!” muttered Wallace, under his
breath. “I’d like to punch his head!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel chatted with Bart and Frank by turns, scarcely
noticing Wallace, who grew more and more angry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Northport Avenue was in fine condition, and that made
the ride very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie Hazle was smitten by the appearance of Diamond,
and it was not long before she found an opportunity
to ask Dustan why he did not introduce Jack. She
did this laughingly, saying it was rather awkward to
find herself at times riding beside some one she did not
know.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan soon found an opportunity to introduce Jack,
and Hattie chatted away to the Virginian in her artless
way. Jack was polite and courteous, but not in the least
effusive. He talked to the pretty girl at his side without
giving her more than an occasional glance, which rather
piqued her, for she was pretty, and she knew it. She was
accustomed to admiration, and the Southerner’s rather
distant manner was something new to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was plain enough that Diamond was not bashful, and
that was what aroused Hattie. Inwardly she resolved to
win attention from him. She was a bright girl, and she
began to sound Diamond, in order to find out as far as
possible what his tastes were. She found he loved flowers,
read Thackeray, Scott and Tennyson, admired handsome
horses and dogs, and thought Frank Merriwell the finest
fellow in the whole wide world. But, although she chatted
intelligently of the things Jack liked best, she gave it
up and rode forward a bit till she was beside Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no use,” she laughed, speaking so Mabel alone
could hear, “I can’t make an impression on the Virginian.
He is bullet proof. Wonder if all Southerners are that
way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll chance it that he is in love,” laughed Mabel. “He
must be!” exclaimed Hattie. “But even if he is, he’s the
first fellow I ever saw who wouldn’t flirt a little.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he will not flirt at all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a bit!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, there are others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Mabel!” exclaimed the dark-haired girl. “I
thought you signed the pledge never, never to use slang
again. Why, since I signed that pledge, slang gives me
that tired feeling. I’m dead sore on anything like slang.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then Hattie wondered why Mabel laughed so
merrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel found an opportunity to ask Frank about Jack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie says he acts as if he is in love,” laughed the
light-haired girl. “Is it true? I know it is by the expression
on your face! Oh, do tell us about it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, do!” urged Hattie, riding up on the other side of
Frank. “I am awfully curious now. I am dead stuck on
anything romantic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How about slang, Hattie?” asked Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Goodness! I forgot! You see, Mr. Merriwell, we
have taken the pledge never, never to use slang any more,
and you can bet we are going to keep it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, as both Frank and Mabel laughed, she realized
what she said, and her face grew crimson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s awful!” she declared. “But we girls picked up
those things at school, and we find it hard to get rid of
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell us about Mr. Diamond,” urged Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, please,” entreated Hattie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tempt me, girls,” confessed Frank; “but I do not
believe in giving away a friend. Excuse me for that bit
of slang, but nothing else seems to express my meaning
so perfectly. I can tell you nothing of Mr. Diamond’s
love affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he has an affair?” exclaimed Hattie. “I knew it!
Now I wonder if he is so constant that he absolutely
will not flirt? If he is, he’s the first fellow I ever saw
taken that way. You try him, Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will if I get a good opportunity,” said Miss Mischief;
“and then if he does flirt, I’ll tell him what I think
of him. I’d like to find one fellow who would be constant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope she doesn’t mean anything!” murmured Hodge,
reddening somewhat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me she does,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel found an opportunity to chat with Jack before
Northport was reached. They came to a hill that was not
particularly difficult, but she complained that her wheel
ran hard, and said something was the matter with it. She
asked Jack if he would not examine it, and so they dismounted
at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond looked over the wheel in a systematic manner,
but could find nothing the matter with it. He got
out his oiler and oiled it. Then Mabel said she did not
feel like riding up the hill, so they walked up together,
for the Virginian would not leave her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, Mabel Mischief was the kind of a girl to attract
the Virginian. Jack was dark and passionate, while she
was light and gay. Without appearing to, she brought all
her arts to bear on him in the short time given her to do
so, but the result was not what she expected, for he did
not seem at all impressed. On reaching favorable ground,
he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Miss Mitshef, we can overtake the others in a
short time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not even venture to call her Miss Mischief, although
everyone else did so, but was particular to pronounce
her name correctly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not like to ride fast,” she smiled, looking up at
him. “We are in sight of them. What is the need of
hurrying?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know,” said Jack. “I thought you would enjoy
being with your friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am satisfied with present company,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he looked away, without appearing to hear her,
and called her attention to the view, which was charming.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have beautiful scenery around here,” he observed,
in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, very!” she said, somewhat sharply; “but I have
seen it so much that I am tired of it. Let’s talk about
something else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think Hattie Hazle a pretty girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe she is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You ‘believe so’! Why, didn’t you notice?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not in particular.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you are a queer fellow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Decidedly. Now, what sort of a girl do you admire
most?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I’m sure I—I don’t know,” stammered Jack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There must be some girl somewhere who is your ideal.
Think of her. Describe her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The face of the Virginian grew crimson, and he betrayed
himself by his confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, Miss Mitshef,” he said, “I think the others
are wondering where we are. I see them looking back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Wallace and Woodock who are looking back.
Woodock annoys me and Wallace bothers Hattie. They
will not let us alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Jack suddenly straightened up, grimly saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If they dare to annoy you during this ride, Miss Mitshef,
they shall answer to me! A fellow who forces his
attentions on a lady is no gentleman, and he deserves to be
soundly whipped. If you need my assistance, I shall be
ready to aid you in any manner possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Mr. Diamond,” she said, with sincere gratitude.
“I shall not forget your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, strange to say, she was ready to ride forward
and overtake the others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>DIAMOND’S OPINION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Hattie, eagerly, “what success?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Diamond,” said Mabel, with wonderful seriousness
for her, “is a perfect gentleman and a splendid fellow.
I am sure now that he is in love, and he will be
true to the fortunate girl. There are not many fellows
like him, and the girl who finds one is lucky.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Mabel!” exclaimed the dark-haired girl, “I believe
you are more than half in love with him yourself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Mabel was confused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I am,” she finally said, with a defiant toss of
her head. “Even if I am, I wouldn’t try to cut the other
girl out. I have satisfied myself that he is constant, and
that was what I was trying to do. Had he flirted with me,
I was ready to give him a calling down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you hear, Hodge?” laughed Merriwell. “Beware
how you flirt with Belfast girls. They are liable to be
fooling you all the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I’ll not dare look at one of them after this,” said
Bart, with an air of absolute seriousness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not be frightened so easily,” smiled Mabel.
“Not every fellow is a Diamond.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is complimentary for us,” said Frank, ruefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very!” nodded Bart. “It makes me feel jolly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It makes me feel jollied,” declared Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you are a flirt by nature,” asserted Hattie, speaking
to Frank. “You can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is growing jollier and jollier!” murmured Merriwell.
“It is a very warm evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just a trifle,” nodded Hodge. “This time Diamond
has the start on you, Merry. He’s won the admiration of
both of these girls without trying to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Miss Mischief,” said Frank, “you are right about
Jack Diamond—he is a splendid fellow. He has his odd
streaks, like anyone else. Sometimes he is petulant and
almost offensive, but his heart is all right, and I never
permit any of his moods to change my feelings toward
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” agreed Hodge. “Merriwell will stand
more from Diamond than from any other fellow living.
I don’t know why, but I do know that anybody else would
have cut Diamond long ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doesn’t he always come around right in the end?”
asked Frank. “Among all my friends there is not a man
who will fight for me quicker or harder than Jack Diamond.
You know that, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” admitted Hodge, reluctantly, “I suppose it’s
only right to give the fellow his due, and I know he would
lay down his life for you if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Among all of Frank’s friends, Diamond was the only
one for whom Hodge entertained real feelings of jealousy.
He could not help being jealous of the Virginian; but,
profiting by Merry’s example and teachings, he tried to
crush the feeling out of his heart and be just with the
Southerner.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the cool shadows of a perfect summer evening they
reached Newport, which is a summer resort at the present
time, although it was originally a camp-meeting
ground. Located at one of the most beautiful spots
around Penobscot Bay, it was but natural that Northport
should become something more than a place where a
religious sect met to worship one week every year. From
a small beginning it had grown to a village of handsome
summer cottages and a first-class hotel, which are occupied
all through the warm summer months, and is literally
overflowing with visitors the last of August. Beyond
the limits of the “camp ground” on the “South
Shore” are various places of amusement, such as bowling
alleys, billiard rooms and a dance hall, where dances are
held at regular intervals through the season and every
afternoon and evening during “camp-meeting week.”
There is also a hotel on the South Shore and a host of
cottages, owned by persons who do not care to be restricted
at any season by the rules of the camp ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>Northport is a place of gayety at the height of the season,
and of the crowds that swarm there camp-meeting
week, not one out of ten goes to attend the meeting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two miles to the south of Northport, at Temple
Heights, is a spiritualist camp ground that is rapidly becoming
a popular resort.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Boston boat touches at Northport during the “season,”
and a stage line connects with the railroad at Belfast,
so the resort is easily accessible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many business men of Belfast own cottages at Northport
and spend the hot summer months there, riding to
and from the city, mornings and nights, on bicycles or the
small steamer that makes several trips a day.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cycling party from Belfast came down the curving
road toward the Northport House, their bells ringing
merrily. They made a pretty show in the dim evening
light, even though they had not lighted their lanterns.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girls went straight to a Belfast cottage, while the
boys took their wheels to the Northport House, where
they were cared for by attendants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond strolled away by himself. Merriwell went out
upon the broad veranda of the hotel and looked away
over the bay, where the moon was just rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the green in front of the hotel some wandering musicians
were playing “Kathleen Mavourneen,” and a hundred
people were listening on the benches and the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge came out and stopped at Frank’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jove, Merry!” he exclaimed, “this is fine! I’m glad
we came.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So am I,” said Frank, softly. “Hush!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was listening to the music. It stirred a responsive
chord in his soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beautiful!” he whispered, as the last sweet strains
died away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come,” said Hodge, brusquely. “Don’t get sentimental,
old man. Let’s take a stroll together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait. They are going to play again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The musicians played “O Promise Me,” and again
Frank was thrilled. As they played, Merry softly sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O promise me that some day you and I</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Will take our love together to some sky——”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, say, come on!” impatiently exclaimed Hodge.
“Let’s find the girls.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What girls?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Miss Mischief and Miss Hazle, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was thinking of some other girls,” said Frank,
quietly. “It seems but yesterday that we were at Fardale.
Have you forgotten May Blossom, Bart?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know. You seem greatly interested in these
Belfast young ladies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s struck you? Great Scott! are you preaching—to
me? Why, you do not hesitate, when you see a pretty
girl, to seek her society. You seem to forget Inza Burrage
and Elsie Bellwood for the time. Oh, you can’t
preach to me, old man! It won’t go down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank felt the blood rush to his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, Hodge,” he said. “Perhaps I deserve
this calling down from you. But my eyes have been
opened somewhat to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Hattie Hazle and Mabel Mischief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those girls divined Jack Diamond’s secret. They discovered
that he was in love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They did not make a success of their attempt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was the result?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You heard Mabel Mischief express her sentiments.
You heard her say how much she respected Jack. Up to
that moment I had thought her frothy and thoughtless.
Then I discovered that she did think and reason, and she
opened my eyes, for she showed me how much respect a
fellow commands who is constant to one girl. I met her
first, Hodge, but I know that at this minute she thinks
far more of Jack Diamond than she does of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What of that? There are others. And I didn’t suppose
you were pledged to any girl, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I fail to understand what the matter is with you.
I know you admire Inza Burrage, and she thinks a great
deal of you; but I also know that you like Elsie Bellwood
just as well, and I think she cares more for you than
Inza ever can. Those are not all the ones, either. There
are other bright, smart girls whom you admire and respect.
You are not engaged to any of them. What are
you going to do while you are not in their society? Because
you think a great deal of some girl, are you going
to shun all others as if you were married and settled
down?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I can’t say that I ever have,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, and it’s too late to begin now. It’s all right for
Diamond to do so if he wishes; but I think it is equally
right for you to do as you have done in the past. The
time will come some day, without doubt, when you cannot
do so. Until that time does come, get all the pleasure
out of life that you can, and what is more enjoyable
than the society of an intelligent, charming and pretty
girl?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was astonished by Bart’s words and manner, for
it was seldom that Hodge expressed himself thus freely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is good logic, old man,” he confessed, “but those
musicians have awakened thoughts of a little girl with
blue eyes and golden hair, and I don’t think I care for the
society of either Miss Mischief or Miss Hazle at present.
Let’s stroll down to the shore.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They did so, and found Diamond sitting on some
bowlders, looking off over the bay in the track of moonlight
which seemed to lead toward Bar Harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There he is,” said Hodge. “Thinking of the girl at
Bar Harbor, I’ll bet something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long have you been here, old man?” asked Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Less than a minute,” answered Jack. “Just stopped
here. Isn’t the moonlight beautiful on the water?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, but when a fellow gets to watching the moonlight
all alone by himself it means something. I think
Hattie Hazle was right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About what?” asked the Virginian, quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She said you were in love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack said not a word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Mabel Mischief settled it. Two nice girls, eh?
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you want my honest opinion of them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you know I am always very careful about what
I say concerning the fair sex.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would not say this to anyone else, but I know neither
you nor Hodge will repeat it. Those girls are bright
enough and are pretty, but they are too forward. I think
the bicycle is responsible for it, but I notice that girls
who ride are likely to be that way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately both Merriwell and Hodge protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not necessarily,” said Frank. “I know many young
ladies who are just as much ladies since they have begun to
ride as they were before. If a girl is inclined to be unladylike,
it is possible that riding a wheel may give her more
opportunities to show her real nature than anything else.
But the wheel is not to blame. It simply shows the person’s
real nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I take exceptions, Jack, to your statement that
those girls are bold. They were pleased by your appearance,
and they tried to make themselves agreeable to you.
That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may be wrong,” admitted Jack; “but it seemed boldness.
I wouldn’t say so to anyone else. Do not repeat
it for the world! It might reach their ears, and I’d rather
do anything than say a word to hurt the feelings of a
lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But his words had already reached the ears of Mabel
and Hattie, for the girls were sitting on a flat stone and
leaning against a bowlder less than thirty feet away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE FIGHT ON THE BEACH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>As soon as Merriwell, Hodge and Diamond walked
away, the girls arose and hurried from the spot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I could kill him!” flared Hattie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel said nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked down the beach till they came to some
steps that led up to an unoccupied cottage. They sat down
on the steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To think that fellow could say anything like that
about us!” exclaimed Hattie, passionately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is dreadful,” acknowledged Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dreadful! Why, it’s awful! He said we were bold!
Oh! Ugh! How I hate him! How I hate him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t get so excited, Hattie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, haven’t I every reason to get excited? Oh, I’d
like to tell Mr. Jack Diamond what I think of him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel sat still and looked out upon the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t mean for us to hear it,” she said, after a
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he said it! It’s just as bad!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Pretty soon there was a queer sound in Mabel’s throat.
Hattie looked at her in astonishment. Mabel was sobbing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Above the bank there was grass on the ground, so the
feet of two lads walking along there made no sound.
They halted in amazement, looking down at the girls.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie had placed her arm about her friend, and was
trying to comfort her, saying swiftly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wretch! How did he dare say it! He has broken
your heart, Mabel! How can fellows be so mean!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is Miss Mischief and Miss Hazle, Bart,” said Frank
Merriwell. “Somebody has insulted them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d like to punch the head of the fellow who would
dare!” growled Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>They heard him and looked up quickly. Then the
boys were in a quandary, not knowing exactly what to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must pretend we did not know she was crying,”
said Frank. “We must go down there, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He whispered the words, and Hodge nodded. So they
descended the bank, greeting the girls cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have been looking for you,” declared Frank.
“How fortunate we found you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, very fortunate,” said Hattie, a strange inflection
in her voice. “We have something to say to you—something
we wish you to tell a particular friend of yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie, stop!” gasped Mabel. “Would you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I would!” flashed Hattie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mustn’t!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must! Your friend, Mr. Diamond, expressed his
opinion of us a short time ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was astounded and confused. For once in his
life he did not know what to say. He wondered how these
girls had learned what Jack said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie, be still!” cried Mabel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Diamond was kind enough to say he thought us
bold,” said Hattie. “And Mabel is crying over it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so sorry,” said Frank, as he sat down on a stone
at the foot of the steps. “Mr. Diamond would not have
hurt Miss Mitshef’s feelings for the world. I assure you,
he is a perfect gentleman, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He should not form opinions on such short acquaintance!”
cried Hattie, still very angry. “He has no right to
judge us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid he has,” said Mabel, much to the surprise
of all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?” gasped the dark-haired girl. “It
can’t be that you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what I cried over,” said Mabel, with a hysterical
little laugh. “I knew Mr. Diamond spoke the
truth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart Hodge staggered, and Frank caught his breath,
while Hattie Hazle was speechless with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He had a reason to think me bold,” Mabel went on,
swiftly. “I gave him that reason, for didn’t I do my best
to flirt with him? A girl who does anything of the sort
must expect the fellows to say she is bold. I don’t blame
Mr. Diamond, for I know he did not say it to harm me,
and he did not dream it would reach my ears. He was
right! And he taught me a lesson. Folks have called
me Mabel Mischief, and I have fancied I could do just as
I pleased. Now I know I must be careful, for I am no
longer a little girl. I owe Mr. Diamond a debt of gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie Hazle was quite overcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Mabel!” she said, “do you really mean it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, I mean it, Hattie. For the first time in my
life I understand how my carelessness may be regarded by
a stranger. In the future I shall be careful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you do not hate Jack Diamond?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, for he spoke the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I declare!”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was all Hattie could say. She had been very
angry a short time before, but now she was bewildered.
It was some time before she could see the matter in the
same light as Mabel did, but, after a while, the light-haired
girl convinced her that they had really given the
Virginian every reason to say what he did. Then Hattie
became very sober, and it was plain that she was meditating.
She realized at last that her thoughtless conduct
had given people opportunities to talk about her. And
then, all at once, realizing her position, she jumped up,
saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Mabel, let’s go to the cottage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As she turned around, she saw three persons who were
looking down at them from the bank above.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, there they are!” exclaimed the voice of Walter
Wallace. “You are right, Mr. Flynn, in what you said
about Merriwell and his friends. They are up to their
tricks. But we are three to their two, and now is our
chance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on, then!” urged the hoarse voice of Parker
Flynn, and the trio came charging down the bank, the
third one being Mart Woodock.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out, Merriwell!” shouted Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Frank was on his feet, ready to meet their assailants,
and, a moment after, a savage battle was taking place
there on the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get away, girls—get away quick!” urged Frank. “If
people come and find you here, your names will be drawn
into this affair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girls heeded the warning and ran away swiftly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take that, you cur!” cried Hodge, striking Wallace
fairly in the mouth. “You will find all the fight you want
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Back to back, Bart!” hissed Merry. “It’s not the
first time we have fought that way!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Back to back they placed themselves, and they fought
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Parker Flynn was there, and he was eager to get at
Merry. He held a large stone in one hand, and he watched
his chance to strike Frank with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll crack his skull if I hit him right!” grated the
fellow. “In a fight like this it would not count against
me, for it would not be possible to tell who did the job.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was watching Flynn, for he knew the fellow
was desperate, and would hesitate at nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Woodock considered himself something of a fighter, and
he did make it hot for Merriwell for a few moments; but
Frank got in a blow that dazed the fellow and made him
wary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge found Wallace not eager to follow him up, and
this caused him to break away from the back-to-back
program for a moment and leap toward Walter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Smack!—Hodge landed with his left, and Wallace was
stretched on the sand. Then Hodge sprang back to defend
Frank’s rear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn fancied he saw his opportunity, and he made a
rush to get at Frank from behind. As Hodge whirled into
his position, the stone in Flynn’s hand came down on his
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without a cry or a moan, Bart dropped and lay still.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wrong one!” gasped Flynn, dropping the stone.
“I’ve finished him, too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he wheeled suddenly and took to his heels.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>A NIGHT OF ANXIETY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Wallace and Woodock both heard Flynn say, “I have
finished him!” and they saw Bart stretched on the
ground. When the ruffian took to his heels they did not
waste much time in following his example, and the trio
soon disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finding himself alone with Hodge, Frank quickly
knelt at the side of his fallen friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bart!” he anxiously exclaimed; “are you hurt much?
Speak—answer me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hodge did not speak, and his face looked pale and
ghastly in the white moonlight that streamed across the
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sudden fear seized Merriwell, for he, also, had heard
the words of the ruffian, Flynn. Was Hodge dead?</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank looked for a wound, but could find none. He
would not have been surprised had he found the stones of
the beach red with the blood of his friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he felt for Bart’s heart, but it seemed that there
was not so much as a fluttering beneath his hand, and
his fear turned to horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has killed Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The words came in a hoarse gasp from Merry’s lips.
And then, suddenly, he reproached himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was a fool!” he said. “If I had sworn out a warrant
for the wretch and set an officer on his track, this
would not have happened. I am to blame! Oh, but I
will avenge my friend! I am aroused at last!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Too late!</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed that the evening breeze whispered the words
in his ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the criminal must not escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment several persons, attracted by the sounds
of the conflict, came hurrying to the spot. They found
Frank endeavoring to arouse Bart. To their questions
Merriwell replied by telling them just what had happened
and who were responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, it can’t be Walter Wallace who had anything to
do with this!” exclaimed a Belfast man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was concerned,” declared Merriwell; “but he is not
the one most guilty. I do not fancy he knew one of his
companions had murder in his heart. Find Parker Flynn.
He is the one who must suffer for this!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he described Flynn, and some of the men hastened
away to give the alarm and attempt to apprehend the perpetrator
of the deed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge was lifted and carried into the cottage. There
did not seem to be a cut upon his head, but there was a
contusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A doctor must be summoned at once!” said Merriwell,
who was becoming more and more alarmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps Dr. Mann is somewhere on the ground. He
comes down often. Send somebody to the hotel to look for
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Dr. Mann was not on the ground. He had not
come down from the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every effort was being made to restore Bart, but he lay
in a heavy stupor, although he was breathing and his heart
could be felt fluttering irregularly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the wheelmen heard what had happened, and
came to the cottage. Harold Dustan was on hand, and he
said he would send a fast rider to the city for a doctor.
This was done, but the doctor was out making a call, which
caused some delay, as another one had to be summoned,
and it was not easy to find one who wished to ride to
Northport that night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Till the physician arrived Frank Merriwell hovered
over his friend. Diamond came, took one look at Hodge,
and then plunged out of the cottage, muttering an oath
of vengeance as he went. Frank knew the Virginian had
gone to aid in the search for Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither Wallace nor Woodock could be found on the
ground. They had appeared in breathless haste at the
hotel and taken their wheels out. No one knew whither
they had gone, but it was plain they had taken flight,
overcome with terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctor examined Hodge, and set about doing everything
possible to bring the unfortunate lad out of the
stupor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How badly is he hurt, doctor?” asked Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know yet,” was the physician’s candid confession.
“He should have come round before this. His
skull may be fractured, but I do not think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If not, why does he remain in this stupor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps his brain was injured by the shock. It is
possible there is a blood clot forming on his brain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If so——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will hope it is not so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The manner in which the doctor uttered the words
showed that he regarded the case as hopeless, if a clot
should form on Bart’s brain. He had spoken plainly so
that he might be understood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And all this came about through my negligence in
letting that rascal alone!” thought Frank, reproachfully.
“If I had set the officers after him when he tried to stab
me in Belfast, Bart would not be there on that bed, dying,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank spent a night of acute torture. He reproached
himself constantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several of the wheelmen stayed at Northport, anxious
to learn the result of the doctor’s efforts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toward morning Bart opened his eyes and looked
around in a wondering way. Frank uttered a low exclamation
of thankfulness, and would have spoken, but the
doctor motioned for him to be silent, whispering in his
ear:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait. Let him speak first. Don’t shock him now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After some time Hodge muttered thickly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you may speak to him,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there anything I can do for you, old man?” asked
Frank, gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do for me?” repeated Bart, vaguely. “What’s the
matter? I’m in bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My head——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were hurt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hurt? How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were struck on the head, you know. Don’t you
remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I almost remember. I knew something had happened.
Now—I am beginning to remember! Flynn—he meant
to do you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he struck you instead of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s it! I remember seeing him just as he struck,
but I didn’t have time to dodge. He must have hit me a
good one. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twenty men are hunting for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hope they catch him! He ought to be hanged! Got
to shut him up now, Merry, or he’ll do you next.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think that’s right, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it. Ought to have done it before. He’s a bad
one. I’m tired. I want to sleep. We’ll talk it over in
the morning. Can I sleep here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it’s all right. Sleep as much as you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. Good-night, Merry. You’re a brick! Don’t
let Flynn do you up. I’ll stand by you, Merry. Good-night.
I’m fagged out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes closed wearily, and he slept.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will he be all right in the morning, doctor?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think so,” answered the doctor; “but that was an
awful blow. We can’t tell the result of it. He may
never be in as good condition as he was before, but we’ll
hope that he comes round all right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was wearied. He wondered where Diamond
could be, but he knew well enough Jack was doing everything
in his power to catch Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Morning was not far away when Frank lay down upon a
couch and fell asleep. He was exhausted, and he slept
soundly till some time after the sun had risen. He was
aroused by the owner of the cottage, who informed him
that a boy had just said that he was wanted at the telephone
in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart was sleeping. Frank took one look at him, and
then hastened over to the hotel. He was shown the ’phone.
As soon as he spoke, a voice asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you, Merry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Jack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Frank. “What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Want you to come to Belfast in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have Flynn located here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nab him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t do it very well till you swear out a warrant for
him. I am watching him. Make time getting here, old
man, and we’ll pinch the scoundrel. I will wait for you at
the Windsor. Come on, now, and don’t let any grass
grow under your bike.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. I’ll be there in a very short time. Don’t
let Flynn get away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bang!—up on the fork went the receiver. Ting-lingling!—Merry
 rang off. Scoot!—he made a rush for the
room where the bicycles had been stored.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three minutes later he carried his wheel out of the
hotel. He mounted it in a moment, and away he flew up
the little hill and out of sight on his way to Belfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank fairly flew over the dusty road. It was well for
him that there was no law for scorching on Northport
Avenue, for he was going like an express train when he
reached that long, straight strip of road leading into Belfast.
Behind him rose a thin cloud of dust picked up by
the tires of his wheels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another thing that favored Frank was that it was
early in the morning, and there were not many teams on
the avenue. Around Belfast there had been so much riding
that few horses minded a wheel more than they did
another team, and Frank did not find it necessary to
slacken speed for any of them he met.</p>

<p class='c010'>People stared at him in amazement as he flitted past
like the wind. They had seen fast riding, but never anything
quite like this. Those who obtained a glimpse of
his hard-set face and gleaming eyes were certain it was a
case of life or death, and that he must be riding thus furiously
for a doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into Belfast sped Merriwell. His one fear was that his
enemy, the wretch who had struck Hodge down, would
escape. He was determined now. Flynn should be punished
as he deserved. Thomaston prison should hold the
wretch. It made no difference that it would cost time
and trouble to prosecute. Frank thought of Hodge lying
in a stupor nearly all the night, of his anguish as he
watched beside his faintly breathing friend, of the vows
he had repeated, and there was not an atom of mercy in
his heart. Indeed, he felt as if he had never known
mercy for an enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bicycle sang its whirring song beneath him, and it
seemed to urge him to still greater exertion. His heart
swelled with a fierce longing to clutch and hold the wretch
he sought. He pictured the satisfaction he would feel as
he cornered the scoundrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he approached the Windsor he saw Jack Diamond
was there, and that caused his heart to leap, for he felt
that Flynn had not escaped. Scarcely slacking the speed
of his wheel, he made a flying leap, his feet struck the
ground, he ran forward a few steps and stood before the
Virginian, panting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Scott!” gasped Diamond. “How did you get
here so soon? Didn’t expect you for ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank’s hand shot out, his fingers fastened on Jack’s
shoulder, and he shook the Southerner, as he almost
snarled:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Steady,” cautioned the Virginian, who had been cautioned
himself and held in check a hundred times by
Frank. “He is right here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Inside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The hotel?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lead the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a second.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is your warrant? This man must be arrested in
proper style. It won’t do to attempt to take him by main
force without the proper authority.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And while we dinky around he may take the alarm
and escape.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The door of his room is watched. I have Dustan on
guard there. He can’t come out of that room without
Dustan seeing him. He won’t get away, Frank. You are
cool enough usually, but now——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All night I have watched beside the bed of a friend
struck down by that devil, not knowing but that friend
might die before morning. All my coolness was eaten
away by the fury that gnawed at my heart. Sometimes
I believe I would have killed Flynn without hesitation had
I been able to reach him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Something like satisfaction filled the heart of Jack Diamond,
for Merriwell’s general coolness and self-control
had been exasperating to him more than once. He had
felt that Frank was altogether too cool under exasperating
circumstances, and he had almost doubted that the
great Yale pitcher could be stirred and utterly controlled
by his passions. Now, however, he saw that, for once at
least, Frank Merriwell was betraying the same emotions
any other fellow in his position might feel, and that gave
Diamond absolute pleasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed strange to the hot-blooded Virginian to be
counseling caution and doing all in his power to hold
Frank in check. It was a novel experience, and he realized
that such a thing was not likely to happen again, so
he made the most of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The proper officers are waiting in the office of the
hotel, Frank,” said Jack, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What officers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A lawyer, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do I want of a lawyer now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you must have a warrant. The sheriff is there,
also, and he will be able to serve the warrant as soon as
you swear it out. I could have done this, but I thought
it best to leave it all to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was right,” said Frank, a change coming over
him—a change that was so sudden that it startled Jack,
for Merry seemed to suddenly become as cool as ice.
“You have done well, Diamond. Let’s get to work in
short order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack led the way into the hotel. As he had said, a lawyer
and an officer were waiting in the office. Two or
three others were present.</p>

<p class='c010'>In short order Frank swore out a warrant against Parker
Flynn, charging the scoundrel with assault with murderous
intent. The paper was placed in the hands of the
officer to serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up the stairs they went, officer, Merriwell, Diamond,
and two or three others. They approached the door of a
room before which stood Harold Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hasn’t offered to come out,” said Dustan, softly.
“I think he is asleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Rat-tat-tat!—the knuckles of the sheriff beat a tattoo on
the panel of the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>No answer. All was quiet within that room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the sheriff knocked loudly, but still there was no
answer. He turned the knob and shook the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Open this door!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not a sound from within.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Open it, in the name of the law!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Even that failed to elicit a response.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank grew impatient.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There must be a duplicate key,” he said. “Let’s have
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will get it,” said the clerk, and he started downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank knelt in front of the door and tried to peer
through the keyhole, but he quickly said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a key in this lock on the inside!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he must be in there,” said Diamond. “It’s no use
for him to play this kind of a game. We’ll have him
soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A sudden thought came to Merry. What if Flynn
had committed suicide? The fellow was rattleheaded and
desperate. Without doubt he drank heavily. No one
could tell what such a man might do.</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk came with the key, but it could not be used.
Again the sheriff demanded admittance, and again there
was no answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Break down the door!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait!” cried the clerk—“wait till I find the proprietor!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will pay for the door!” exclaimed Frank. “Go
ahead, Mr. Officer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sheriff set his shoulder against the door and gave
a surge. Then there was a crash and the door flew open.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the room they went.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was empty! Flynn was not there!</p>

<p class='c010'>The window was open. Out of it dangled a rope.
Frank leaped forward and looked out into the back yard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s gone!” cried Merriwell, fiercely. “He knew he
was watched, and he has given us the slip!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s this?” exclaimed Jack, catching up a sheet of
paper from the stand. “He’s left a note here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Diamond read aloud:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know this room is watched. You think you have me
caught, but I will fool you. When I found myself
watched, I came here and took this room, which I have
occupied before, because I knew it would be easy to drop
out into the back yard and give you the slip that way.
But I am not done with Mr. Frank Merriwell. He has
robbed me, and I will get at him yet. My time is coming.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE RUINED BRIDGE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“I believe I am on the trail at last!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank Merriwell uttered the words. It was two hours
after Flynn’s escape from the Windsor, and a dozen persons
had been searching for the man ever since.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank had found that Flynn, after restoring the hired
wheel, in his possession, to the dealer of whom he had obtained
it, had returned that very morning and bought the
wheel outright, taking it away with him. This was at a
time after he retired to the room in the hotel, and was, beyond
a doubt, after his escape into the back yard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Merry reasoned that the fellow had purchased the
wheel to aid him in escaping from the city. Merriwell,
Diamond and several of the Belfast wheelmen set out by
different streets in the attempt to get on the track of the
fugitive. Frank had ridden north, toward City Point,
making inquiries as he went. At last he received information
that led him to believe he was on the right scent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Over the bridge and into the country beyond rode
Frank. He found a man who had seen a bicyclist pass an
hour before, and the description fitted Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first the road was furrowed by many teams that had
gone into the city that morning, and it was useless to look
for the track of a bicycle. This made it necessary for
Frank to halt many times to make inquiries, and he knew
the fugitive was gaining on him if he were pushing on
steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind!” said Merry, with savage determination,
“if I am on the right trail, I’ll never give up till I have
run him down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once or twice he proceeded some distance on the wrong
road, and was forced to turn back and take another course.
These mistakes were exasperating.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun rose higher and higher till it blazed down with
crushing heat from almost directly overhead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never supposed it would be so hot up here in this
country,” muttered the pursuer.</p>

<p class='c010'>But heat did not cause him to slacken his pace. He
drove forward steadily, covered with dirt and perspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the forenoon he tracked Flynn. He was miles from
Belfast, having passed through Waldo, Brooks, Monroe
and other places. At noon he was in a hilly country,
where the roads were rough and dangerous. He found
where the man he was after had stopped at a farmhouse
and eaten dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank did not stop there. On the dusty road he could
see the trail of the bicycle. It was plain enough now,
and he did not need to ask questions. He knew he was
riding in pursuit, for the track told him that, as the resistance
of the air to the bicycle, and, in a lesser degree,
the resistance of the roadway, caused furrows to appear
on either side of the bicycle track, and those furrows
formed an angle with the track of the bicycle in the direction
in which it was going. Frank had discovered by
observation that a bicycle could be tracked in the right
direction on a dusty road with the aid of these telltale
furrows, and now his knowledge stood him in good stead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The intense heat continued, but in the northwest black
“thunder heads” were pushing upward against the sky.
Pretty soon the thunder began to mutter and rumble.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A shower is coming,” thought Frank, “and it will blot
out this trail. Can’t I overtake the fellow before the
rain strikes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Onward he flew. He drove his wheel up a hard hill
that was thickly wooded. When he reached the top he
saw that the rain would soon strike him. Jagged flashes
of lightning shot athwart the black clouds, which had
risen till they were almost over his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>He started to descend the hill, but had not gone far
before he saw an old road that led off into the woods,
and toward that road a single track turned out of the dust
of the main highway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately he leaped from his wheel and quickly
turned it into the old road.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am close upon him!” thought Frank. “Not a moment
is to be wasted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He mounted again and drove onward, as fast as he
could ride, over the unused road. Through a long opening
amid the trees he caught a glimpse of another rider
just disappearing from view.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There he is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A terrible crash of thunder drowned his words. There
was a hush in the woods—the hush before the storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>The road grew steeper and steeper, but Frank rode at
furious speed, for something told him there was danger
that he would be given the slip once more by Flynn.
Ahead of him the road curved out of sight, but he knew
the foot of the steep hill must be near. He managed to
keep his feet on the pedals, but did not try to hold the
flying bicycle in check.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round the curve he sped, and then a gasp of alarm escaped
his lips, for directly ahead of him was a small river,
and where it had been spanned at one time by an old
bridge, only the rotting, sagging timbers were left. The
planking had been torn away, leaving only the stringers.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was right upon the ruined bridge, and, finding he
could not stop, he felt certain that he was rushing to certain
destruction. And nowhere before him could he see
Parker Flynn. He had been tricked by the rascal, who
might be watching him at that moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the very last moment, Frank turned his wheel so
that it struck one of the stringers, to which broken pieces
of planking still clung. In a most remarkable manner, he
held the wheel steady, and straight along that stringer it
shot. Even then, in that moment of peril, he remembered
seeing a bicycle that lay under the water at the bottom
of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>How he crossed that stringer he could not tell, but he
did so, reaching the other side in safety. It was a most
miraculous feat, and was more of a chance than anything
else.</p>

<p class='c010'>Off the bicycle he sprang, and back to the bridge he
rushed. He walked out on the stringer and looked down
at the bicycle beneath the water. From some timbers
fluttered a strip of cloth. He looked down the stream,
and in an eddy he could see a hat floating round and
round. Then he hurried to the bank, made his way down
the river, secured a long stick and drew the hat in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Flynn’s!” he said, before his hand touched it. “He
did not escape going into the river, and he must have
struck with terrible force against some of these broken
timbers. It’s two to one he’s drowned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Securing the hat, he found the name of a Boston dealer
inside, and there was no longer a doubt in his mind but it
had belonged to Parker Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a patter of rain on the leaves and a distant
roar that told of the coming downpour. At a distance
up the river was an old mill, and toward this Merry hurried.
He reached it just as the storm broke in all its
fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>For an hour the rain came down in torrents, the lightning
blazed and the thunder shook the earth. When it
was all over, Frank started out to find Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not find the man. After searching till late in
the afternoon, he secured the aid of a number of farmers.
At nightfall they had found nothing. Some of them were
certain the body of the man would be recovered from a
pond into which the river ran about a mile below the
broken bridge, but night brought an end to the search.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c010'>Nearly forty-eight hours later Frank rode back into
Belfast. His disappearance and prolonged absence had
caused great wonder and excitement, and his return was
hailed with satisfaction. He went straight to the rooms
of the Belfast Wheelmen and found Diamond there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank told the story of his pursuit, and expressed regret
at being forced to say that neither Flynn alive nor his
body had been found, but the farmers who had assisted in
the search were confident that, in time, the body would be
recovered from the pond.</p>

<p class='c010'>He asked anxiously for Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bart is all right,” said Diamond. “He has had the
very best of care. Yesterday he was brought up from
Northport, and you can’t guess where he is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is at Miss Mitshef’s home. She told her mother
all about the encounter, and Mrs. Mitshef insisted that
Bart be brought there and stay there till he had quite recovered.
He has recovered already, but he knows when
he is well off, and he is pretending to be an invalid. I
don’t blame him, either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh? Why, I thought——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, Frank!” said Jack, quickly. “I know I expressed
an unfavorable opinion of certain young ladies, but
I want to take everything back. I was up there last
evening to see Bart. Hattie Hazle was there, and I have
changed my mind concerning those girls. Mabel Mitshef
is cultivated and refined, as also is Hattie Hazle, although
she seems to entertain a positive dislike for me. I was
altogether too hasty in forming an opinion of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here!” exclaimed Frank, with a twinkle in his
eyes. “It can’t be you are forgetting the little girl at Bar
Harbor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack blushed, but quickly said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a bit of it, Merriwell! But I did want to retract
what I said about these girls here. There is to be a party
at Miss Mitshef’s house to-night, and we are all invited.
If you did not return, it was to be postponed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we will attend the party,” smiled Frank. “I am
ready for a little pleasure after what I have passed through
in the last three days.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>HANS SINGS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>From a handsome residence on High Street, Belfast,
came the sounds of music, singing and merry laughter.
From top to bottom the house was brightly illuminated,
and the sounds from within told that it was overflowing
with light-hearted young people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mabel Mitshef, or “Mischief,” as she was almost universally
called, was giving her party, and Frank Merriwell
and his friends, Hodge, Diamond, Browning and
Dunnerwust, were invited guests.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving out Hans, Frank’s party formed a fine quartet,
and their singing of college songs had been received
with great applause. “Solomon Levi,” “Bingo,” “Stars
of the Summer Night,” all the old favorites came in turn,
and still the cry was for more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning gave up from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no use,” he said; “I’m not in training. Can’t keep
it up, you know. I beg you to excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, being urged, Frank sang one of the late popular
songs, Jack accompanying him on the piano. Never had
he sung better, and never had those present heard anything
that pleased them more. There was a great burst
of applause when he finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beautiful!” murmured Hattie Hazle, a handsome,
dark-eyed girl. “I don’t wonder all the girls fall in love
with Mr. Merriwell, for he does everything divinely! His
singing is enough to make anyone adore him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’d pelief you nefer heardt me sung,” said Hans,
who sat near her. “Oh, you haf missed der dreat uf my
life! I vos a pird!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Mr. Dunnerwust,” cried Hattie, a twinkle in her
eyes, “I am just perfectly crazy to hear you sing! I’ve
been wanting to ask you, but didn’t dare, you know.
Won’t you sing us a solo?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he does, I hope he will sing it so low I can’t hear it,”
muttered Browning. “I’ve heard him sing. The toothache
is delirious delight compared to his singing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale,” said Hans, with assumed modesty, “I don’d
put meinseluf vorwart as no brimer donners, but I can
vawble in a vay dot vill surbrise you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a fact,” nodded Bruce. “Everybody secure a
supply of cotton before he begins. You will need it to
stop your ears.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot vos dot?” demanded the Dutch boy, angrily.
“You vos shelus, dot’s vot’s der madder you mit! You
knew I vos goin’ to took der shine off vrom your sunging,
und you don’d vant me to done dot. Vale, Misder Prowning,
you don’d run der vorld!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, don’t mind him, Mr. Dunnerwust,” said Hattie.
“I am sure we are all very anxious to hear you sing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, indeed!” cried several other girls, taking the cue
from Hattie and crowding about Hans. “Please sing, Mr.
Dunnerwust.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale,” said Hans, smiling and putting his hand over
his face in a manner meant to express great embarrassment,
“it vill gif you great bleasure—no, I mean it vill
gif me great bleasure to sung to der laties. I nefer could
resist der laties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He arose and bowed, with his hand on his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how charming!” cried several of the girls, who
had been given the tip by Merriwell early in the evening
to have sport with the Dutch boy. “Do sing, Mr. Dunnerwust!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before you begin, Hans,” laughed Frank, “you had
better make sure no one in the room has a gun.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Coot cracious!” gurgled the Dutch boy, staring at
Frank. “Vos you shelus, too? I didn’d oxbect dot vrom
you, Vrankie. Py Chorch! This vos a surbrise vor
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be a surprise for a great many when you begin
to sing,” sighed the big Yale man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mister Prowning, your remarks vos oxceeding der
blace out uf. Laties, vot shall I sung to you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, anything!” cried Hattie. “Make your own selection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I nefer sing any dose common songs uf. Der oldt
songs vos goot enough me vor, such as, ‘Holdt der Vort
Up,’ ‘Bull der Shore Vor,’ ‘Vait Till der Glouts Roll Pie,
Shenny,’ ‘Der Oldt Oaken Pocket,’ und such as dose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, do sing ‘The Old Oaken Bucket,’” urged Hattie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, do!” cried the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, I ain’d sung dot some dime vor, but id peen my
vavorite song. I vill gif him to you, laties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who will accompany you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’d needed nottings dot kindt uf. I can done my
own accombanying. Shust kept sdill now, und I vill
wable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hans took a position in the middle of the room,
threw his chest out and his head back, opened his mouth
and let out some very remarkable sounds. This is his
version of “The Old Oaken Bucket” as he gave it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How tear to your heart der scenes uf my shildhoot vos alretty yet,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By the time he got that far the entire gathering was convulsed
with laughter. As he had been singing with his
eyes closed, he had not seen them laughing, but now he
opened his eyes and caught his breath in preparation for
starting in on the next verse.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not start. The shout of laughter that went up
made him stagger and gasp.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stared around blankly, and then he looked disgusted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Py Chorch!” he muttered, “I pelief they vos laughin’
me at!”</p>

<p class='c010'>In high indignation he stalked to his seat, and dropped
down heavily, dragging a handkerchief out of his pocket
and mopping the perspiration off his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was laughing as heartily as anyone. Even Jack
Diamond was smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried Hattie Hazle, with her handkerchief
over her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale,” said Hans, sadly, “I nefer oxbected you vould
laugh me at, Miss Hazles!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! oh! oh!” gasped Hattie. “I’m—not—laughing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot you vos doin’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I’m—crying!” she shrieked, with another outburst.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dot vos vunny! Vot you vos gryin’ vor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! oh! Because—because I am so—so affected—by—your—singing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She managed to utter the words, and then she fell over
into the arms of a girl friend and went into another
paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hans was in doubt. Somehow it did not seem to him
that she was weeping, but she had said so, and he concluded
that it might be her way of shedding tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot you thinks uf dot, Misder Pruce Prowning?” he
demanded. “You nefer made anypody gry your singing
py your whole life in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, Hans; but this matter is serious. You
have broken her all up, and she is liable to have convulsions
and die. If she expires, you will be responsible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shimminy Gristmas!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be a very sad affair, but you have committed
murder already.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot?” squawked Hans. “Murter? Vot you meant
py dot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You just murdered ‘The Old Oaken Bucket’ in the
most horrible manner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hans gasped and gurgled, and then he grew red in the
face. Leaning toward Bruce, he hoarsely hissed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’d vant to made any drouble der bresence uf der
laties in, but I vill fighted you on der oudside der house uf
a minute in uf you dare gone ut mit me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Bruce declined to go out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Time flew swiftly that evening. ’Mid games, charades,
music, refreshments, merry chatter and merry laughter,
eleven o’clock came round with amazing speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the clock was striking eleven, Hattie Hazle came
in from another room to the parlor, where most of the
guests were, and hurried straight toward Frank Merriwell.
She was seen to whisper something in his ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank looked surprised and doubtful, and then she appeared
to urge him to do something, and he finally smiled
and nodded. A moment later, he arose and left the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie had fancied that her act was unobserved, for
Hans Dunnerwust was attempting to tell a funny story,
and he had snarled himself up in such a manner that
everyone seemed shouting with laughter and giving their
entire attention to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jack Diamond had not missed the girl’s act, and on
his face there was a look of displeasure and anxiety.
When Merry started to leave the room, the Virginian
reached out a hand as if to stop him, but seemed to change
his mind, for he let Frank go.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jack watched Hattie closely. He saw her join in
with the merry throng and seem as light-hearted and gay
as any of them. Indeed, Hattie and Mabel were leaders
in their set.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond did not mean to take his eyes off the dark-haired
girl, but Browning came up, suppressing a yawn
with an effort and said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m getting bored. When are we to make our escape?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, very soon, I think,” said Jack. “It is getting
late.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The party will not break up before twelve. Are we
to remain and see the agony through?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. Merriwell will settle——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond paused and began to look around the room, an
expression of anxiety on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s gone!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh?” grunted the big Yale man. “What did you
say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you see Hattie Hazle anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oho!” laughed Bruce. “So that is the matter! I
presume you will not go directly from here to the yacht.
Miss Hazle must walk home, and you will——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing of the sort, sir!” interrupted Diamond, flushing
hotly. “I am not chasing every pretty girl I see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No? Well, you are a rare bird among the rising generation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Besides——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know all about the little girl at Bar Harbor, but
she would never know anything about your little flirtations
over here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That makes no difference to me,” came haughtily from
Jack’s lips. “I should know about it, and my sense of
honor——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“More of your Southern notions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps so, but I am rather proud of my Southern
notions, Mr. Browning. That is all, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, apparently almost at a white heat, Diamond left
the big fellow, who sat down wearily on an easy-chair,
murmuring to himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Queer chap, that. He drags honor into everything.
He’ll not even flirt a little with a pretty girl, for he is in
love with a little Boston maiden, Paula Benjamin, who is
at Bar Harbor. And I don’t believe there is anything serious
between them, either, for I am sure he has not proposed
to her. All the same, just as long as he is in love
with her, he’ll not look at another girl. I wonder if all
Virginians are that way. They can’t be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond hurried out of the room. In various parts of
the house he looked for Hattie Hazle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I find her,” he thought, “I will ask her where Frank
has gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not find her.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, Jack came hurrying back to the parlor, a
troubled look on his face. He saw Hodge, and quickly
drew him aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, Bart,” he said, speaking in a low tone and
uttering the words swiftly, “something is up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What? How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll tell you. A while ago Miss Hazle came into this
room in a hurry, just as Hans was trying to tell that
story. I saw her look around till her eyes fell on Frank,
then she hurried to him. No one noticed her but Merry
and myself. She began speaking to him in a low tone,
and I caught a few of her words.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was urging him to do something. At first he
refused, politely, but she insisted, and, after a little, he
gave in. I heard him ask, ‘Where is he?’ Then she said
something I did not catch, and Frank said, ‘All right,
I’ll see him.’ Directly he left this room, and I do not
know where he went.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge looked disappointed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What of that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something is up,” repeated the Virginian. “I feel it—I
know it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t see that you heard anything
to make you think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who did Merry go to see? Everyone of our party
was here in this room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know whom he went to see, and I don’t
know that it concerns me. Jove! I never knew you to
be so curious before, Diamond. This is a new freak for
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack flushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know you think it queer,” he said, swiftly; “but
something tells me Frank is in danger. I did not try to
hear a word that passed between him and Miss Hazle,
but I heard despite myself. I meant to watch her, but
she disappeared suddenly, and I could not find her. I
thought I would ask her frankly where Merry had
gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I think you are putting yourself to a lot of unnecessary
trouble. I don’t understand why you are so
disturbed over a little thing like this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe Frank is in danger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not forgotten that he has enemies in Belfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hasn’t any—now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who could they be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Walter Wallace.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! he never was very dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mart Woodock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he was simply a sort of tool for Wallace. Frank
Merriwell is more than a match for those chaps, and they
are nothing more than two fellows who were envious of
Merry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they tried to do him up. They aided Parker
Flynn in the attack upon you and Merriwell. They were
on hand when Flynn struck you down with a stone and
nearly split your skull.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they were so frightened that they took to their
heels and have not been seen in Belfast since. Oh,
those chaps are not to be worried over. If Flynn were
alive——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who knows he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where there is every evidence of his death!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no evidence of his death that amounts to anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Merry pursued him far up into the country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Flynn went through a broken bridge and was
drowned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What proof is there of that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“His bicycle was found in the water under the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that proof?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“His cap was floating in an eddy of the river, which
must have carried his body down into a pond below.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the body was not recovered, although a search
was made for it, and, as yet, there is no absolute proof of
his death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he had not been drowned, he must have been
found.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not certain of that. He is a crafty fellow, and
he may have resorted to a trick to deceive Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was hunted, and Merriwell had practically run
him down. He knew he could not escape unless he did
so by strategy. The bicycle at the bottom of the river
and the floating cap made it seem that he had plunged into
the river. He knew, if he were not found, that the report
of his death would go out. That would give him time to
escape. He did not know but he was a murderer. It is
probable that he believed he had killed you. He had
every reason to resort to trickery, and I am inclined to
believe that was his game. I do not think Parker Flynn
is dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You astonish me,” said Hodge, slowly, “but you may
be right. However, even though the wretch is alive, I
do not fancy we need worry about him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll not trouble us again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is where I think you make a mistake. You
have not sized up Flynn correctly. That chap is a
thorough desperado, and, at the same time, he is cunning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s certain he would not venture back into Belfast
so soon after what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think he would not dare, and I believe that is the
very thing he would dare. He would reason that no
one would expect him to come back here, and back here
he would come. If he has returned here, he knows by
this time that he did not kill you, Hodge, and once more
he is dangerous, for he will try to get another crack at
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The reasoning of Diamond was beginning to impress
Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I don’t see how you connect this with anything
Hattie Hazle said to Frank,” he spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie Hazle asked him to meet somebody, and he has
gone to meet that person.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At first he refused. That showed it was no one he
regarded as a friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks that way,” confessed Bart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he must have gone to meet an enemy. He maybe
in danger. Let’s go look for him, Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove! I will do it, Diamond. I don’t want him to
think I’d spy on him, but it would be enough to make a
man daffy to have Flynn come back here and get at
Merry. Come on, Jack!”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>AN UNPLEASANT DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The house was surrounded by beautiful grounds. There
were hedges, shrubbery, arbors and retreats.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boys sought Merriwell there. They walked across
the grass, avoiding the gravel walks, and their feet made
no noise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Jack paused and clutched Bart’s arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>They could hear the murmur of voices near at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Forward they stole.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Merry is there,” whispered Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>They could hear him speaking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he is in no danger, we’ll get out in a hurry,” said
Jack, whose heart was beginning to misgive him. “I don’t
want to be nosing into his business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they paused close to a clump of fancifully trimmed
cedars. They could hear a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thank you, Mr. Merriwell, for your generosity in
promising not to make trouble for me. I know you could
do so if you wished, but I give you my word of honor that
I had no idea the fellow, Flynn, meant to do anyone
serious harm when we attacked you. Wallace got me into
it. I’ve got to go home, for they say my mother is nearly
crazy over my absence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all right, Woodock,” said the voice of Frank
Merriwell. “Go home, and be sure I hold no grudge. I
think I can satisfy Hodge. Anyhow, we are going to
leave Belfast to-morrow, if everything is favorable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I wish you good luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, come away!” whispered Diamond, in Bart’s ear,
his tone indicating disgust. “I’ve made a fool of myself.
It’s only Woodock, and he is harmless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Sh!” warned Hodge. “Keep still. They are going.
We have made asses of ourselves, but we don’t want
Merry to know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me to thank you, too, Mr. Merriwell,” said
another voice. “You are very generous. Mart and I
were schoolmates, and when he asked me to see you, I was
glad to help him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the voice of Hattie Hazle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everything is all right,” laughed Merriwell, in his
jolly way. “I hold no grudge. I must get back to the
house, or the fellows will be wondering what has become
of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember my warning,” said the voice of Woodock.
“You have not seen the last of Parker Flynn. I have
reasons to believe he is alive and will trouble you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be the worse for him if he does. I may not see
you again, Woodock, so good-by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment later Jack and Bart saw Merry hurrying toward
the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now is our time,” said Bart. “We’ll follow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Diamond held him back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait,” he whispered. “There go Woodock and Miss
Hazle. He is taking her to the house. We’ll have to
keep still or be seen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They remained quiet till Woodock and the girl reached
the house, where she bade him good-night, and he turned
away, while she entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Girls are peculiar,” muttered Hodge. “I thought that
girl did not care at all for Mart Woodock, but now I
know she really thinks a good deal of him. She would
not have taken all this trouble otherwise. She is a natural
flirt, and she has tormented him till he was jealous.
When he saw Merriwell and I with Hattie and Mabel at
Northport, he attacked us with the others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Diamond seemed so excited that he did not hear
Bart’s words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew it! I knew it!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hey?” said Bart. “Knew what? What are you driving
at?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t I tell you Parker Flynn was not dead?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you heard what Woodock told Merriwell. The
fellow is alive! That is certain now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is it certain? Woodock simply said he had reasons
to believe Flynn alive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s enough. I am sure he did not tell all he knew.
He didn’t dare. He wanted to warn Frank, and so he
told that. Had he told the whole truth, he would have
said that he knew Flynn was alive. I feel sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he knows it, Flynn must be in Belfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told you a short time ago that it would be just like
the fellow to come back here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he wants to keep away from me!” growled
Hodge, tenderly touching his head. “I have a grudge in
store for that whelp, and, if he lives, I’ll settle the score
some time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am thinking about the yacht,” said Jack. “We have
left it entirely alone, thinking there was no need to watch
it now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so. Flynn claims that the <i>White Wings</i> belongs
to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he has made more than one attempt to get possession
of her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it likely that he might make another?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s more than likely. We must see Frank and talk
the matter over. Somebody must be sent to the yacht immediately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not all go? It’s late enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll see about it. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went in and found Frank, and Diamond suggested
that they return to the yacht at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we have not been careful,” he said. “We
should not have left her unguarded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am beginning to think so myself,” confessed Frank;
but he said nothing about Mart Woodock and the warning
he had received.</p>

<p class='c010'>The party was breaking up. Already some of the
guests had departed. Frank found Hans and Bruce, and
told them it was time to leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale,” said Hans, “I haf had der pest time you efer
saw!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They found Mabel Mischief and told her how much
they had enjoyed the evening, after which they bade her
good-night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you sail?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By nine o’clock to-morrow morning, if the wind is
favorable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie and I will come down to see you off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” laughed Hattie, who was standing beside Mabel,
“we will be there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girls shook hands with them all, one after another.
As they started out, Frank began to whistle “Nellie
Was a Lady,” and the others, with the exception of Diamond,
joined in. This was turned into “Marching
Through Georgia,” to which tune they stepped off briskly
toward the steamboat wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they came down the street leading to the wharf
the whistling died out, and they walked on in silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wind is off shore to-night,” said Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope it will hold that way in the morning,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>They reached the wharf. Jack hurried forward and
was the first to reach the steps, at the foot of which
they had left their boat. He went down the steps quickly,
and then a cry came from his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Boat is gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, all the same. Somebody has stolen her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that is interesting!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Of a sudden, Frank turned and hurried out upon the
wharf till he was where he could look over the water toward
the anchored yachts. The moon was down, but the
sky was clear and full of stars, so there was sufficient light
for him to see the yachts.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could not distinguish the <i>White Wings</i> among
them!</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge came hurrying to Frank’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was a mistake to leave the small boat there with the
oars in her,” he said. “Some of these skulkers around the
wharves got away with her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And they have taken the yacht, too!” came hoarsely
from Frank’s lips. “The <i>White Wings</i> is gone!”</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge literally staggered. He clutched Frank’s arm,
as if for support.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It can’t be true!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look for yourself. She is not where she was anchored.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the tide has changed since we left her. She must
have swung round into another position.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right. I have looked for her in the position
she would occupy. She is not there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning came loafing round the corner, grumbling as
he approached.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, this is a great note!” he growled. “How are we
to get on board—walk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You would have quite a walk to-night,” said Frank,
huskily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>White Wings</i> is gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone? How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stolen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The big fellow leaned against the building, utterly
overcome for the time. Diamond and Hans came up,
and Frank explained the situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feared it!” grated the Virginian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” gurgled Hans. “Did dot yotch
valk avay py himseluf alone alretty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know the yacht was stolen, Merry?”
asked Browning. “It may have broken from anchorage
with the turning of the tide, and drifted away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was not possible. The small boat went with the
<i>White Wings</i>. Both were stolen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who by?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Parker Flynn!” cried Jack Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, the fellow is dead—drowned,” said Browning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much! He is alive, and he has that yacht. That
drowning business was a trick. Find Parker Flynn, and
you will find the <i>White Wings</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will find them both,” declared Merriwell, with quiet
determination. “Parker Flynn shall not escape me a second
time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can you follow him?” asked Bart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will follow him if I have to fly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>All knew Merriwell was in earnest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank determined to make sure the yacht was stolen,
and so he searched around till he found a boat that he
could use. He and Diamond got in and rowed off into
the fleet of yachts. They could see nothing of the <i>White
Wings</i>, and, as they were rowing about, they were hailed
from another yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you chaps looking for?” asked a voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For my sloop, <i>White Wings</i>,” answered Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What? Are you the fellow who owns her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, she’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see she is, but I’d like to know where she is gone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t tell you that, but three fellows came off to her
two hours ago, got up the anchor, hoisted sail and made
down the bay. I watched them, because their actions
were suspicious, and it was remarkable that they should
start out at such an hour. I hailed them once, but they
didn’t pay any attention to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That settles it!” exclaimed Frank. “The <i>White Wings</i>
is stolen! I am much obliged to you for the information.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t mention it. I’m sorry I didn’t know those chaps
were stealing her. I might have found a way to stop
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank and Jack rowed ashore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was stolen, fellows,” said Merriwell. “We found
a man who saw her when she was taken. I shall start in
pursuit of her in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?” asked Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will find a way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked up into the city, Frank hurrying forward
in advance. The Windsor Hotel had not closed for the
night, and they went in there, where Frank registered for
them all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” he said, “you had better go to sleep, fellows. I
have some work to do myself, but you can’t help me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I couldn’t sleep if I tried,” declared Diamond. “Let
me go with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right; but the others must turn in and try to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you going to do, Merry?” asked Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not certain yet what I shall do. Sleep, as I have
told you. I shall try to get some sleep myself before
morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He seemed as calm as possible, now. To look at him
and hear him speak, a stranger could not have dreamed
that he had just met with such a loss.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond asked no questions as he and Merriwell left
the Windsor. Jack was confident that Merriwell knew
what he was about.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank proceeded straight to the home of Howard Dustan,
despite the hour, and rang the bell. Ten minutes
later he was talking with Howard himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is this you tell me?” cried Dustan, in amazement.
“Your yacht stolen?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. It was taken while we were at the party to-night.
I suppose it was careless to leave it unguarded,
but I fancied Parker Flynn was out of the way, so there
was little danger that it would be molested. But Martin
Woodock warned me to-night that Flynn was alive and
in Belfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good gracious! What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pursue the robbers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How will you do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have come to you to help me. I want to hire a small,
fast steam launch. Do you know where I can get such a
boat, and have it ready to leave at sunrise to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan whistled, and appeared thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not certain,” he said, slowly. “My uncle owns
such a boat, but I do not think you can get her, for he
always goes with her, and he is ill in bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does your uncle live in the city?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far away?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About a mile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it is asking considerable of you, Dustan, but it
will be a great favor if you will go with me to your
uncle’s house. I wish to get a boat before morning, for
I don’t want the curs who stole my yacht to get too much
of a start. Perhaps I can fix it so your uncle will let
me have his launch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I doubt it, but I will go with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Howard retired into the house to get his coat and hat,
for he had come out in his shirt sleeves. He was not gone
more than two minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty minutes later the boys had obtained admission
to the home of Howard’s uncle, and Frank was talking to
the sick man. At first it seemed that Merry would not be
successful, but he produced five hundred dollars in money,
which he agreed to leave in the man’s possession to insure
him against any damage to the launch, and he offered a
remarkable sum per day for her use. Howard used his
influence, and, at last, Frank won.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be necessary for Howard to go with you,” said
the man, “for he is commissioned to run such a boat, and
you are not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be only too glad to go,” declared Dustan.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>NEWS OF THE STOLEN YACHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Frank Merriwell showed his abilities as a hustler, for
at sunrise he was on board the steam launch <i>Fox</i>, and
ready to start in pursuit of his stolen yacht. The <i>Fox</i>
was lying at a wharf some distance above the steamboat
wharf. She was coaled for a trip, and steam was up as
the sun rose out of the bay beyond the monument in the
harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond, Hodge and Dustan were to accompany
Frank. As the launch was small, Merriwell did not wish
to overload her, so Browning and Dunnerwust were to be
left behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bruce and Hans were at the wharf to see the party off.
It had cost the big Yale man a mighty effort to get out of
bed and come down there at that hour, but now he was
angry to think Frank intended to leave him behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have I done to be left?” he demanded. “I am
sure that if there is to be any fighting, I might do my part
on this trip.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can take you, Bruce,” said Frank, “and I will, if you
are determined to go; but I thought you might be able
to help me some by staying home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to do a little detective work. It is possible
I may not succeed in finding the <i>White Wings</i>. While I
am away, I wish you to do your best to learn who had a
hand in stealing the yacht. If I do not succeed in running
down the rascals who have the yacht, you may be able
to put me on the right track when I return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll make a mighty poor detective,” grumbled Bruce.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know about that. You can do it as well as any
of the others, and this launch is so small that I do not
wish to take the whole party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” said the big fellow, somewhat pacified.
“I’ll do what I can, but I never was cut out for a detective.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mart Woodock may be able to help you. Find him—watch
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All ready, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The call came from Howard Dustan, and Frank stepped
aboard the <i>Fox</i>. The lines were cast off, and, with an
oar, Browning thrust the prow of the craft away from
the wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Goot-py, Vrankie,” called Hans, sadly. “I vos sorry
you vasn’t goin’ mit me. If you catch up mit der vellers
vat stole dot yotch, gif them der tyfil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The propeller began to churn the water. Dustan was at
the wheel, and the <i>Fox</i> soon headed down the harbor.
As long as the wharf could be seen, Hans was visible,
alternately waving a bandanna handkerchief and blowing
his nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Out into the morning sunshine that was tinting the
rippling water with pink and gold danced the little launch.
She ran smoothly and swiftly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which way, Mr. Merriwell?” asked Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe we had better run over to Searsport first,”
said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should we go there?” he asked. “It strikes me
that we will be going out of our way by doing so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Searsport is to the eastward. It is away over in that
direction.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We should go directly down the bay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To overtake the yacht, if it was stolen by Parker
Flynn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I fail to understand your reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, of course Flynn will make an effort to get out
of Penobscot waters as soon as possible. He belongs in
Boston, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For that very reason he will not sail that way. If he
has the yacht, he is just foxy enough to know we may
think he will head for Boston, and so he will choose another
course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may be right,” admitted Diamond, “but still I
have my doubts about it. I do not believe Flynn is as
shrewd as all that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, there is another reason why he would not run
down the bay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wind shifted about shortly after midnight last
night. I observed that. During the first part of the night
it was off shore, but it swung round till it was almost
in the south. At one o’clock the parties on the <i>White
Wings</i> could not have sailed down the bay without beating
to windward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t observe that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did, for I was taking note of just such things after
discovering the yacht was gone. Of course the thieves
wished to get as far away as possible before sunrise, and
they would not beat against the wind. It is my opinion
that they ran over toward the Eastern Bay, which is full
of islands, where they might hide the yacht. It is possible
they will keep on toward Eastport. Anyway, I am
going to look for them in the Eastern Bay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack did not like to give in, but he saw the logic of
Frank’s reasoning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” he said. “You are in command. Do as
you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They made straight for Searsport, but the <i>White Wings</i>
was not in the harbor there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where next?” asked Dustan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Islesborough,” answered Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But that is on the western side of Long Island. If
you are going straight into the Eastern Bay, you must go
round to the north of Long Island.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not going directly into the Eastern Bay. If the
<i>White Wings</i> is not at Islesborough, I shall run down on
this side of Long Island to Pulpit Harbor. The rascals
might take her in there, as it would be a good hiding
place. If she isn’t there, I shall strike round to the
south of the island and over into the Eastern Bay that
way. If they have set their course southeast, we may cut
them off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So for Islesborough they headed and ran into the harbor
there, where they made inquiries of some fishermen,
but could learn nothing. The missing yacht had not been
seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>From Islesborough to Pulpit Harbor was not a very
long run. They crept slowly in at the narrow entrance
of the harbor, where it looked as if a vessel would be in
danger of rubbing her sides against the rocky shores, but
where, at the lowest water, no vessel could touch her
keel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again they were disappointed. The yacht was not
there, and no one at the harbor had seen or heard from
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>They did not waste time, but ran out past the “pulpit”
again and were away like hounds seeking a scent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are so near Camden we may as well run down
there,” said Diamond. “The <i>White Wings</i> is known
there, and, if anybody has seen her, we’ll be likely to hear
of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” agreed Frank. “It may be well enough
to run in to Camden. We’ll go there, Dustan.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the launch was headed toward the distant mountains,
under the shadow of which lies the village that hopes
some day to rival Bar Harbor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mountains were attractive in the sunshine, but
Battie looked insignificant in comparison to Megunticook.
The Summit House could be seen on the crest of Battie,
the sunshine glimmering on its windows and showing the
flag that waved in the breeze from the pole on the top of
the observation tower.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round Sherman’s Point rushed the little launch, past
the steamboat wharf she ran, and headed straight up into
the harbor. She stopped at Adams’ Wharf, and Frank
went ashore to make inquiries. Steam was kept up, and
the <i>Fox</i> was ready to get away as soon as he returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was gone more than thirty minutes, and he returned,
followed by several boys, two of whom were carrying
bundles for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What news?” anxiously asked Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“None,” was the answer. “The yacht has not been
seen. I have bought some provisions. Here, boys, is a
quarter for each of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the boys took the money, but the other drew
back, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you please, Mr. Merriwell, I’d like something of
more value to me than that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” exclaimed Merry, astonished. “Aren’t you
satisfied with a quarter? Why, I thought it good pay for
what you have done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s more than the job was worth. I don’t want
money, but I’d like to have something as a keepsake—something
to remember you by. I’ve read all about you,
but I never expected to see you. Won’t you please give
me one of those buttons off your coat?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was touched.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My boy,” he cried, “you could have the coat if I had
another here to put on! A button? Of course! And
the quarter, too! Take it—keep it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He cut a button off his coat, and gave it to the boy, together
with the quarter. The bundles were taken aboard,
and soon the <i>Fox</i> was speeding out of the harbor, bound
eastward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am well satisfied now,” said Frank, “that the <i>White
Wings</i> did not come down the bay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was midday, and they ate on board the launch. As
they were passing Lime Island they saw a schooner that
was running in from the Eastern Bay. Frank directed
Dustan to run close to the schooner, and he hailed the
vessel, asking if the captain had seen anything of a sloop
yacht named <i>White Wings</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, ay,” was the answer. “Sighted such a schooner
off the southern end of Deer Isle about nine o’clock.
Made out her name after she passed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thunder!” cried Hodge, excitedly. “We’ve struck the
trail at last!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond was excited.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which way was she headed, captain?” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sou’ by sou’wes’, sir,” was the answer. “I reckon
she was makin’ for Green’s Landing or the Reach.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, captain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye’re welcome, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On sped the launch, but now she bore some passengers
who were elated by the piece of news they had
learned. At last they were on the right course.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'>“I believe that is the <i>White Wings</i>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond uttered the exclamation, being in a flurry of
excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was sunset on the Eastern Bay, and far in the distance,
slowly creeping round an island, was a sail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the boys had heard from the <i>White Wings</i>. She
had been seen by some lobster fishermen, and they aided
the pursuers in striking the right course.</p>

<p class='c010'>Green’s Landing had been passed, and they were amid
the islands of the Reach, getting well down, however, toward
Isle au Haut.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Fox</i> was under full head of steam, and she was
making a pretty wake as she sped through the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, for half an hour more of daylight!” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we have enough of it to overtake them,” said
Howard Dustan. “If that is the <i>White Wings</i>, I do not
believe they will get away from us to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sail disappeared beyond the island.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun slowly sank from view, and purple shadows
began to gather about the wooded islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every eye on the <i>Fox</i> was strained to catch another
glimpse of the sail, but it could not be seen. The launch
ran round the island, but still nothing of the sloop was
visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has become of her?” asked Diamond, in disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be she has run into some cove and anchored,”
said Hodge. “She has pulled down her sail, and so we
can’t see her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But where is the cove?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is for us to find.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But they could not find it. Darkness came down all
too swiftly, and they began to lose hope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are close to them,” said Frank. “That is pretty
certain. If they hide from us to-night, we’ll run them
down to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we must find them to-night!” palpitated Diamond,
who was quivering with eagerness. “If we do not, there
is no telling what may happen. They may find a way to
slip us during the night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is hardly probable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? They stole the yacht in the night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they took her in the Western Bay, which is comparatively
free from islands and dangerous ledges. This
bay is full of islands, ledges, sunken reefs and every kind
of danger. They will do no sailing in the night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” nodded Howard Dustan. “If they do,
’tis almost certain they will run the yacht on a ledge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t think much of letting them hide from us
when we were so close upon them,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They must have seen us, and they were crafty enough
to hide. But we have the advantage of them, for we can
sail almost anywhere, while they depend on the wind.
We’ll run them down in the end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan was running slowly now, for he knew they were
in danger of striking a ledge or rock themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was growing darker and darker. Toward shore the
shadows were black, so that a small vessel might lie close
under an island and not be seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What shall we do, Mr. Merriwell?” asked Howard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have to anchor for the night,” said Frank. “The
accommodations for sleeping on board are not the best, but
we’ll have to get along some way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s find some sheltered spot to anchor,” urged Diamond.
“There is a swell here, and it tosses this light boat
around too much to suit me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have to get into the lee of an island somewhere,
if we can’t find a cove,” said Frank. “Why not run over
to that small island there, Dustan?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Near at hand an island rose like a black blot on the
face of the water. It could be faintly seen through the
gloom.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was agreed that shelter might be found near the
smaller island, and so the <i>Fox</i> was headed that way. The
run was made slowly, and the launch crept up to the
island much as a mouse might creep up to smell a sleeping
lion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Close under the shore the swell was broken, and the
light launch rested gently on the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a cove,” said Hodge. “Can we get in there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s narrow,” came doubtfully from Dustan, who was
still at the wheel. “We may strike a sunken rock if we
try to get in there in the darkness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Which way is the tide running?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s coming in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, if we go forward slowly enough, we’ll soon
float off, if we should happen to hang up on a rock. There
is no need to break in the bottom of the launch by running
on at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you chance it?” asked Howard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I’ll pay all damages.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then here goes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they slowly crept in through a cleft in the rocks,
which soon rose black and ugly on both sides of them.
Merriwell lighted the small lantern with which the launch
was provided and crept out on the bow with it in his hand,
so that the light might show Dustan how to steer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The light shone on the smooth water and against the
black sides of the rocks which rose to the right and left.
The motion of the screw set the waves lapping up against
the rocks with a swishing sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are all right in here,” said Dustan, “unless the
water is so shallow that we’ll be aground at low tide.
We’ll have to make a sounding.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The lead and line was taken out, and Diamond sounded.
He found there was enough water so the yacht could not
touch bottom at low tide. Indeed, all were astonished by
the depth of the water. The launch lay close up against
the rocks, and there it was found there was sufficient
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can moor her here,” said Frank. “All that is
needed is some bumpers to keep her from rubbing against
the rocks, and we may be able to find them on shore.
There are two points of rock to which she can be made
fast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a very few moments the launch was moored against
the rocky wall, and then Frank prepared to go ashore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Hodge,” he said, “let’s see if we can find some
timbers that will serve as bumpers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am with you,” said Bart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take the lantern,” advised Dustan. “It may aid you
in your search.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So, linking the lantern chain over his arm, Frank
started to climb up the face of the black rocks. The lantern
swayed and gave out a changing, uncertain light, but
it was better than no light.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge followed Merry, but he took plenty of time to
find the clefts in the rock and fasten his fingers there so
that his hold was secure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reaching the top, Frank turned and gave Bart a hand,
aiding him up. Then they leaned out, Frank holding
the lantern at arm’s length, and looked down on the
boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan and Diamond were looking up at them, the
light of the lantern showing their upturned faces.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That would be a nice position for the launch if an
enemy took a fancy to drop a few large rocks down on
you,” said Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t mention it!” exclaimed Dustan. “You make
me nervous.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There were cedars and small trees on the island, but
Frank began to doubt if they would be able to find what
they wanted. They climbed to the crest of the island,
where they found themselves amid the thick cedars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A fellow might get turned round here so he wouldn’t
know how to find his way back to the launch,” said Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All he’d have to do would be to circle the island,” assured
Frank. “He’d be sure to find it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As they were not provided with an ax, they were not
able to cut anything to serve for bumpers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly, Frank’s hand touched Bart’s wrist, and he
whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They stood still in their tracks, listening intently for
some moments. All was still, save for the breaking of
the swell against the southern end of the island.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was it?” asked Bart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fancied I heard voices.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must have been mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems so, but I could have sworn I heard the voices
of men.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They moved on a few steps, and then up before them
rose a dozen white objects that fled away into the cedars
with a scurrying sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whew! What were those?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge was startled; his voice betrayed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sheep,” laughed Frank. “They gave me a start. The
first one jumped out from under my feet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They looked like spooks, but the rattle of their feet was
no spookish sound. My heart tried to play leap-frog with
itself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There may be a sheep pen of some sort on the island.
If so, we’ll be able to find some timbers for bumpers.
Let’s look for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They continued their search, passing on over the ridge
of the island and making their way through the cedars,
where they fancied they might find the sheep pen they
sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had not gone far on that side of the island before
both halted, and Hodge whispered:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that light down there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what I’m looking at,” said Frank. “It’s not
on the island.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. It’s off shore.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it must be on some kind of vessel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The <i>White Wings</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who knows—it may be!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They were silent as they stood watching the light.
It rose and fell with a gentle motion, telling them beyond
a doubt that it was on a vessel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s go down there,” suggested Hodge. “Perhaps
we can get close enough to make out what she is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank extinguished the lighted lantern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would betray us,” he said. “Now we will go
down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They made their way slowly down through the cedars.
At times they could not see the light, but on coming out
from the thick bushes it was plainly in view.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they approached the shore, they found there was a
cove on that side of the island. It was much larger than
the one they had run into with the <i>Fox</i>, and it was not
so well protected, for the vessel at anchor there felt the
swell which was heaving into the Reach from the open
sea outside.</p>

<p class='c010'>They took every precaution not to be seen or heard,
and crept down close to the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>The light on board the vessel showed them she was
small, and the longer they watched her the firmer became
their conviction that she was the stolen yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we could get off to her without arousing those on
board, we’d be able to capture her, Bart,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s try it!” palpitated Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Swim!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We might do that, but we could not carry any
weapons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t need them. We’ll find something after we get
on board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge was quivering with eagerness. The thought of
making such an attempt filled his heart with a fierce longing
for the struggle. He felt that he was ready for any
sort of adventure, as long as Frank Merriwell was with
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first Frank was inclined to take the desperate venture.
It would not be difficult to swim out to the vessel,
and, in all probability, those on board of her would be
asleep. It was possible she could be taken without much
of a struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came another scheme. Why not return to the
launch, back out of the cove on her, creep round the
island, lay alongside the yacht, board her and take her
that way?</p>

<p class='c010'>That seemed the better plan, and he whispered it to
Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a surprise it would be for Diamond and Dustan
if we were to do the job all alone,” said Bart, who seemed
reluctant to give up the original scheme.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That would be very fine, but we know from report
that at least three men were concerned in stealing the
yacht. What if we boarded her, cramped by the cold of
the water, and were overcome by numbers? That would
be a bad piece of business. I think we had better use
every precaution.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you are in charge of this business, and I am
ready to do as you say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then let’s go back to the launch and tell the others
what we have discovered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They made their way back into the cedars, and climbed
to the crest of the island. From that point the light
could not be seen, as some of the cedars intercepted their
view.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we know it is down there,” said Hodge, who
was glowing with enthusiasm caused by their discovery.
“It’s on the <i>White Wings</i>, too, and we’ll soon have her
back, Merry. What will you do to the rascals who stole
her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll not decide on that till I recover the yacht,” said
Frank. “We have not got her yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we shall!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not such an easy thing to go straight to the
cove in the rocks where lay the <i>Fox</i>. Frank decided
that the light from the lantern might aid them, and, as
they were hidden so no one on the vessel could see them,
he lighted up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a time they came to the cove, but here a great
surprise awaited them. Looking down into the cleft amid
the rocks, they could see nothing of the <i>Fox</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cove was empty!</p>

<p class='c010'>“This can’t be the place, Frank!” exclaimed Bart.
“The launch is not here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the place where we left her, just the same,” said
Merriwell. “Right here is where we climbed up the
rocks, and down there are the points to which she was
made fast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It can’t be, for she isn’t here now, and we can see
the most of this little cove.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has moved,” said Frank, “but she must be near.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he softly hailed, calling Diamond’s name.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no answer!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all the mysterious things that ever happened, I
think this is the strangest!” gasped Hodge, bewildered.
“I can see now that this is where we left her, but she has
vanished.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As completely as if the island had swallowed her.
Neither Dustan nor Diamond would have thought of
leaving this spot till we returned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They looked into each other’s eyes by the light of the
lantern, which Frank held up, and they seemed utterly
bewildered. Again and again Frank called.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind them there was a sound. They leaped up and
turned. In the darkness two black forms loomed. The
lantern was dashed from Frank’s hand and shattered on
the rocks, from which it bounded, striking with a splash
in the water below.</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment later Frank and Bart were engaged in a
desperate struggle with unknown assailants.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE FIGHT IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The attack came suddenly, and the boys were but poorly
prepared for it. However, they promptly grappled with
their assailants, who seemed trying to force them over
the edge of the rocks into the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the unknown foes uttered a savage curse, but
the other spoke not a word, grappling with Hodge and
trying to fasten his hands on Bart’s throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fight for your life, Frank!” grated Bart. “We are
trapped!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He forced the man off and struck him with his fist.
Still not a sound came from the unknown, while fingers
seemed to sink into Bart’s shoulder with a grip of iron,
drawing him close.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Hodge tried to break the hold of the fellow, but
he could not succeed. With his left he smote the man
in the face, but still those iron fingers held fast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart felt himself forced backward. He realized that
his assailant was a person of enormous strength, and it
seemed that he had met more than his match.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Bart was a fighter, and he never gave up while he
could breathe. Some lads might have weakened and
begged, but the very fact that he seemed pitted against
his master made him fight all the more savagely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Blow followed blow, till Bart could no longer strike
with effect. He knew he had left his mark on the face
of the man. He was beginning to gasp.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three times did the unknown try to fasten his fingers
on Bart’s throat, and three times was he foiled by the
boy, who now felt that he was, indeed, fighting for his
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something terrible and deadly about the
manner in which the silent man endeavored to get a
crushing hold on Hodge. At last, Bart panted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>No reply. The struggle continued with unabated
fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart was forced to his knees, but he got upon his feet
again. He wondered how Frank was making out, but
could not get breath to call to his friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once his feet slipped and he felt that he was going
over the brink into the water below, but he held fast to
the man, and the unknown dragged him back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came a time when Bart’s assailant lifted his fist
and struck the boy on the temple. Hodge was stunned.
He reeled and flung up both hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quick as thought the man caught up the boy and flung
him over the brink. Bart whirled through the air, struck
the surface of the water with a great splash, and sunk.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime, Frank had been fighting fiercely, although
taken at a disadvantage. Once he flung the
stranger fairly over his head, but the man was up instantly,
and, as Frank had slipped in doing the trick, it
proved a misfortune to Merry, who was caught from
behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Frank’s assailant uttered a sound, but this time
it was a laugh of triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have you now,” grated a hoarse voice in Merriwell’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know!” returned Frank. “That’s not so
sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gripped his body with a quick motion, and both
rolled on the ground. Over and over they went. When
they rose, the unknown was still clinging to Frank, having
him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Merriwell did not cease struggling for an instant.
He did not seem to need to rest, for he continued to fight
as fiercely as at the start, and he succeeded, at last, in
breaking the hold of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank whirled and grappled with the unknown.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now it is different!” he half laughed. “It’s not all going
your way, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m no friend of yours!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Excuse the slip.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank forced the man off with his left hand, and then
struck him with his right. It was too close, however, for
the blow to be effective, and it simply seemed to sting
the fellow to greater fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the unknown began to exhaust himself with his
furious efforts to beat Frank down and conquer him. He
panted and snarled, but Merry was his match.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was waiting till the time when he could go at the
man and do him up. He could see his enemy was exhausting
his wind in frantic struggles to win at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the battle continued till Merry heard a great splash
in the water of the cove, and, a moment later, a man
came rushing to the assistance of Frank’s foe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve fixed t’other feller!” palpitated the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then get in and give me a lift!” growled the one who
was trying to conquer Merry. “This chap is the Old
Nick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank knew now that he was fighting against desperate
odds. They were two against him, and they were determined
to destroy him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The thought that Bart had met with his end infuriated
Merriwell. He had heard the splash in the water, and his
imagination pictured Hodge flung down from the rocks,
stabbed through the heart. Perhaps the water was
stained at that moment with the lifeblood of poor Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Smack!—Frank got in a swinging blow that sent one
of the men staggering backward to fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other leaped upon him, trying to crush him down.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank squirmed about, obtained a hold upon the man,
and gave him a wrenching twist, jerking him off his
feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Down upon his back went the fellow, and Merriwell
knelt on his breast, dropping heavily to knock the wind
out of the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other was up, and he sprang upon Frank’s back.
Frank ducked quick as a flash, and the fellow went flying
over his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry felt for a stone. His blood was boiling, and he
longed for a weapon with which he could avenge his
friend. His hand found one, but it was not large enough.
However, he arose with it, and flung it at one of the men
who was coming at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stone struck the man in the breast and stopped him
for an instant. Then Frank found an opportunity to
reach for his revolver. He snapped it out of his pocket,
laughing loudly. That laugh had a deadly ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man who had been struck by the stone rushed at
him again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep off!” cried Frank. “I shall shoot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shoot, hang you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Snap!—the hammer fell, but there was no report.
The revolver had missed fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the man closed in with Merry, grappling the
weapon. Frank pulled the trigger again in the struggle.
There was a report, a spout of fire, and a bullet went
whistling skyward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was trying to wrench the revolver from
Frank’s grasp, and, for some seconds, they fought over
it. Frank had a firm hold, and it could not be taken
from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Discovering this, the unknown tried to force him down
on his knees. Frank knew not a few wrestling tricks, and
he used one of them on the man, who clung to the revolver
as he dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry was dragged down, and, on the ground, the
struggle for possession of the revolver continued. Frank
felt that to lose it meant sure death, for he was certain
his enemies would not stop or hesitate at murder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still hanging to the revolver with one hand, the man
secured a stone with the other, and then he struck Frank
on the head. The blow caused Merry to see stars, but
did not rob him of strength so that the ruffian could wrest
the revolver from his fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the stone descended. This time it was a glancing
blow. Frank flopped the fellow over in a moment and
sat up astride his body, tearing his fingers from the
revolver.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I can shoot you!” cried Merry. “I would be
justified in doing it, for you have tried to murder me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man struggled to fling him off, but Frank held him
there, pushing the revolver against his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep still!”</p>

<p class='c010'>For the moment Merry had forgotten the other man.
Now there was a grating sound behind him, and then he
received another blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c010'>That one was enough. Without a moan or a gasp, he
fell over on the ground, stricken senseless!</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE CAPTIVE ON THE YACHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>When Frank recovered consciousness he discovered
that he was bound with stout cords and was being carried
by two men. One of the men stumbled and swore. The
other said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s not much farther to the boat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This feller is heavy,” said the one who had stumbled.
“An’ he’s ther blamedest fighter I ever saw. If I hadn’t
cracked him on the head with a stun he’d done you up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I slipped. That was the way he got the best of me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bah! He was more than a match for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s wuss’n any man I ever tackled. He fit like a
tiger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well we’ve got him now, and I will settle my score
with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank knew the voice of the last speaker, and he realized
that he was in the power of a man who had become
his fiercest enemy—Parker Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they carried him, Frank strained at the cords that
held his wrists, but they held fast, showing that the men
had tied him securely. They did not feel him straining,
for they were stumbling over the rough ground, slowly
picking their way through the darkness. They passed
through some cedars, and the branches slapped the captive
in the face.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank thought of crying for help, but something told
him that it would be useless to make an outcry. He remembered
that Hodge had been cast from the rocks into
the water of the little cove, from which the launch and
the two lads left in charge of it had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>What had become of Diamond and Dustan? Had they
been assailed and overcome while Frank and Bart were
exploring the island? Merriwell feared so.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wind rushed through the cedars, and the surf beat
against the island with a roar that seemed growing louder
and louder. Clouds were in the sky, and the stars were
being blotted out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Storm comin’,” said one of the men. “We ain’t
anchored in a very good place, either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll move,” said Flynn’s voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you don’t know but a blamed little about this
bay, fer ye wouldn’t ask that question if ye did. It’s full
of ledges, and I don’t want to take the chance of pilin’
the yacht onter one of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you said you knew every inch of both
bays?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you can sail the yacht out of here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want daylight to do that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will chance it. We must get away to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The chaps we had the tussle with have friends near.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I s’pose so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those friends will be looking for Merriwell and the
other fellow before long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s likely.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They may find the other fellow floating in the water,
but I don’t want them to find Merriwell or know what
became of him. He will disappear this night. If the
fish do not eat him, his body may be found floating in
the bay some time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank felt a chill run along his spine as he heard the
cold-blooded words of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t hire out to do no killin’, or have any hand
in it,” said Flynn’s companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor am I going to do any killing, but I think Mr.
Merriwell can be disposed of without much trouble.
Stand by me, Steve, and I’ll double the sum I agreed to
pay you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s according to what you are goin’ to do,” muttered
the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll tell you my plan after we get on board the yacht.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Frank Merriwell knew the full extent of his danger.
He realized that Flynn was a ruffian of the most
desperate character, who would not stop at anything in
order to put a foe out of the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>The words of the men had told the captive that Diamond
and Dustan were unharmed, but the disappearance
of the launch was a mystery still.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he was carried down the rough slope, Frank saw a
light below, and he knew that they were taking him to his
own yacht, which lay rolling on the swell that reached
into the cove.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men reached the shore, and there lay a boat, which
they quickly launched, leaving Frank on the beach. Then
they picked Merry up and unceremoniously tossed him
into the bottom of the boat, quickly rowing off toward
the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they approached the yacht they were hailed by some
person on board, and they answered. A few seconds later
the boat bumped against the side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give a hand, Wallace,” called Flynn. “Help us hoist
this chap on board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The fellow on the yacht uttered an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have you there?” he asked, and Frank knew it
was Walter Wallace, of Belfast, who had become Merry’s
enemy because Frank and Bart had dared to carry on a
mild sort of flirtation with Mabel Mischief and Hattie
Hazle. Wallace was very jealous, and he had been concerned
in the attack on Merry and Bart when the latter
was knocked out by a blow on the head. Thinking Hodge
far more seriously injured than he really was Wallace had
disappeared and kept out of sight. Now he was
again in company with Parker Flynn, the man who had
struck the blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Naturally reckless and headstrong, Wallace’s inclinations
led him to the bad, and now that his feet were set
upon the wrong course, he had no desire to turn back.
But he was not yet a hardened ruffian, as he betrayed before
the night was over.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was dragged to the deck of his stolen yacht
and dropped down as if he were an inanimate thing. As
he lay there in the darkness, hearing the men taking care
of the small boat, he again struggled to free himself of the
cords that held him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no use,” was his final decision. “Those knots
were tied by a sailor, and they will not slip.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was making his wrists sore, and he gave up the
struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pretty soon Flynn came and stood near him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, Steve,” he called, “we’ll take him below.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sailor approached, and Frank was carried down into
the cabin, which was lighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>On getting into the light, Flynn saw that Merriwell
was conscious.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you’ve come around,” he sneered, with an evil look
on his face. “I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He, too, was dressed roughly, like a sailor, and on his
face was a stubbed beard, showing he had not been shaved
for a week.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was placed in a sitting position, and then Flynn
stood up before him, showing his hatred by the look
on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t seem tickled to be on board the <i>White
Wings</i> again,” he sneered. “Don’t suppose you expected
to come aboard in this fashion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hardly,” admitted Frank, quietly. “But still it’s better
than not coming aboard at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will not think so before I am done with you,”
came threateningly from Flynn’s lips. “You’ll curse the
day you ever saw this boat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk that way! You frighten me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you can pretend to be awfully cool about it, but
you won’t be so cool when you know what I am going to
do with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I need to be warmed up. Perhaps you had better tell
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will find out soon enough. You thought me dead.
Ha! ha! How I fooled you! But I did get a drop into
the river. I was hiding under some bushes which hung over
into the water while you were searching for me. As soon
as you were gone I crawled out and took to the woods.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I left the bicycle, for I wanted you to think I was
drowned. The trick worked all right, and you left the
yacht unguarded. Under any circumstances you did not
suppose I would return to Belfast, even though I was not
dead; but I came back there, and I didn’t lose any time
in getting possession of my property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Excuse me; you mean my property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! This boat belongs to me. I swore I would have
her, and I have kept the oath. You did not know what
sort of man you were dealing with when you tried to bluff
Parker Flynn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s a fact! Had I known, I should have stopped
in Boston long enough to put you behind iron bars for
attempted fraud. That would have saved me no end of
trouble and annoyance on this trip. But you are sure to
land behind the bars in time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will not have the satisfaction of seeing me there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much. To-night you will be put where you will
trouble no one in the future.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Having uttered those ominous words, Flynn went on
deck, followed by the others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>TOWARD THE OPEN SEA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Being left alone, Frank tried to devise some method
of securing his freedom. From the sounds he could hear,
it became evident that the anchor was being raised, the
sails run up and the yacht gotten under way. This told
that Flynn had carried the day in persuading the man he
called Steve to run out from the island that night.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last Merry understood just what sort of ruffian
Flynn was, and he could not help feeling uneasiness over
the final words of the man as he left the cabin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn had told Steve that he did not intend to do any
killing, but his words had made it evident that he had
a plan of disposing of his captive in a manner that would
put that captive forever out of the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wind was rising, and the <i>White Wings</i> heeled as
soon as she was out of the cove into open water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn came down the companion way and entered the
cabin. His eyes were glittering, and he grinned as he
looked his captive over.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a fine night for my plan,” he said, gleefully.
“The wind is northeast, and the tide is turning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Frank knew nothing of the man’s purpose, he remained
silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn sat down and took out a pipe, which he proceeded
to fill and light. He puffed away a short time, and then
settled back in a comfortable position, scanning Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t take more than two hours to run down to
York Island,” he said. “Then it’s only a short run out
past the Eastern Ear and The Horses. Steve says there
won’t be anything but the open ocean outside when we
get there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank wondered what the man was driving at, and
Flynn grinned when he saw the look of curiosity on
Merry’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Outside The Horses,” he went on, “the wind has a
clean rake down across from the Bay of Fundy. It’s
rising every minute, and a small boat won’t stand much
show in the seas there will be out there, especially without
so much as a pair of oars in her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank began to see a light; he fancied he understood
what the man meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You stand a fine show of piling the <i>White Wings</i> on a
ledge long before you get out past The Horses,” said
Merry, who remembered The Horses as two ledges he
had observed on his chart located to the south of York
Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much danger of that,” said Flynn. “Steve knows
every inch of the bay. He can tell where every rock
lies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so dark but he can run her out to open sea. The
tide is high, too, so there’s not much danger of striking
a ledge. Oh, don’t worry for the yacht! We’ll take care
of her. You can think about yourself a little.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank felt a sensation of rage rising within him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will come out all right,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t think so after a while, young man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been in worse scrapes than this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I doubt it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have, and I’m here now. I’ll tell you something,
Mr. Flynn. The time will come, and it is not very far
away, when you and I will settle our account.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” nodded Flynn. “That time will come
to-night. I shall put you into an open boat and set you
adrift with the tide running out to sea and the wind
northeast. You will not see daylight, for the tide and the
wind will take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a look of triumphant satisfaction on the
evil face of the man, and Merriwell knew that he would
carry out his dastardly plan. He would not kill Frank
outright, but he would set him adrift with not one chance
in a hundred for him to escape drowning.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a pleasant prospect, but Merriwell kept his
nerve and looked his enemy straight in the eye, quietly
saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you want to make a sure thing of it, take my advice
and hit me over the head with an ax before putting me
into the boat. If you do not, just as sure as fate, I’ll
escape, and hunt you down!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the coolness with which the boy uttered those
words, they caused Flynn to pale a bit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anyone would think to hear you that you are a chap
whose life is protected by a charm,” he sneered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I have passed through too many dangers to
have my life snuffed out down here in this part of the
world, by such a miserable, worthless creature as you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be careful!” snarled Flynn, rising. “Better keep
that tongue still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank laughed. It was the old reckless laugh that
often came from his lips in times of danger. He did not
quail in the least before the threatening man, and the
scorn that blazed from his eyes was withering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My tongue is my own, and it gives me great satisfaction
to be able to use it to tell you just what a miserable
cur you are. You are a thorough coward at heart, and
you know it. It was a mistake that you were created
in the form of a man. You should have been a snake to
crawl along the ground.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a fierce cry, Flynn struck Merry’s mouth with his
clinched fist, cutting Frank’s lips and causing them to
bleed a bit.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Frank laughed again!</p>

<p class='c010'>“That proves my words true!” he exclaimed, and
Flynn shrank away, awed at last by the display of fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Snarling like a dog, the man rushed out of the cabin,
leaving Frank alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the <i>White Wings</i> raced through the night toward
the open sea.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>CAST ADRIFT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“Good-by, Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn was leaning over the stern of the <i>White Wings</i>,
which was tossing on the heavy seas, and looked down into
the small boat where Frank, still bound, had been cast.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the last moment, Walter Wallace had rebelled and
tried to prevent Flynn from carrying out his plan. He
had been silenced by a blow that knocked him flat upon
the deck. Steve, the sailor, had taken no hand in the
work, but Flynn had carried it out alone, and now he
was preparing to set the small boat adrift.</p>

<p class='c010'>At times the clouds scudding across the sky broke and
showed a few half-smothered stars. Somehow, even
when no stars could be seen, it was not intensely dark
on the face of the troubled water, which seemed to give
out a light of its own.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it was a bad night, and everything seemed to indicate
that a storm was approaching. The wind howled
and the sea made a rushing sound. In the distance it
could be heard thundering on The Horses.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come!” growled the sailor at the wheel; “be lively
there, Flynn. We’ve got to git in somewhere before long.
This ain’t no place for us to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-by, Frank Merriwell!” repeated the man who
leaned over the stern, holding the painter of the small boat
in his hands. “You’ll go out to sea, and that boat will
swamp long before morning. This is the last of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think so,” said Frank, his voice steady and firm,
“but I tell you again that I’ll live to see you punished for
this dastardly work. If you want to make a sure job of
this, you had better finish me now before you set the boat
adrift.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn seemed to hesitate. At that moment a fear entered
his heart that Merriwell would escape in some manner
and keep his vow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would be easy to finish you,” said the ruffian, reaching
into his hip pocket and pulling out a revolver. “I
could fill you full of lead. Perhaps I’d better!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He lifted the weapon, but Steve caught his arm with a
furious exclamation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“None of that!” shouted the sailor, hoarsely. “You can
set the boy adrift, but you can’t murder him before my
eyes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s murder, anyway,” came huskily from Walter Wallace,
who, reckless fellow though he was, was now sick at
heart. “I am against it. I didn’t agree to take a hand in
anything like this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shut up!” howled Flynn, who seemed half demented
by his fierce desire to destroy Frank Merriwell. “You
came along of your own free will, and it won’t be good
for you if you squawk now!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t come along to have any hand in such business
as this. I wash my hands of it. When the time
comes, I’ll swear who did the job. That’s what I’ll do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will, eh?” shouted the man with the revolver, now
raging like a maniac. “What do you think of that, Steve?
This young fool will give us away! He threatens us! He
was ready enough to come with us——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I did not like Frank Merriwell,” said Wallace;
“but I didn’t suppose you were going to do anything
more than take this yacht, which you declared was
rightfully yours, anyway. Had I known just what sort
of a fellow you were, you can be sure I would not have
run into this scrape.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace was a rascal at heart, but he had no relish for
anything like murder, and he was weakening. The
thought that he might be concerned in a murder had
taken the courage out of him, and now he hoped to force
Flynn to give over his bloodthirsty scheme.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already, in his mind, Wallace was thinking that, if he
succeeded, Merriwell would owe him his life. Of course
Frank would be grateful, and Wallace would not be held
responsible for his share in stealing the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Belfast boy did not know the character of the
man with whom he was dealing. A thorough ruffian at
heart, Flynn did not pause to count the cost of any rash
act. He did not think that some time in the future, if
Frank Merriwell was drowned that night, he might be
tried for murder and convicted. He did not have imagination
enough to fancy himself standing at the bar,
securely ironed and charged with the dastardly crime he
contemplated committing at that moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some men commit crimes from lack of imagination;
some commit them because they have too much imagination.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hold this line, Steve!” snarled Flynn, thrusting the
end of the painter into the hand of the man at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steve obeyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn advanced straight on Wallace, revolver in hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” he grated, lifting the weapon, “you do just as
I say, or by the skies! I’ll shoot you in your tracks!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace realized that the ruffian meant what he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“March aft!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Flynn’s command, and Wallace dared not disobey.
He marched to the stern of the boat, and the man
followed, holding the revolver ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get over into that boat!” snarled Flynn, savagely.
“Be lively, or I’ll sink some lead in you and then throw
you over!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean to do?” gasped Wallace, now
thoroughly frightened and cowering.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get over!” yelled Flynn, furiously. “I am going to
shoot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Belfast lad started to obey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please don’t make me get into the boat!” he whimpered,
beginning to cry. “I didn’t mean anything! I’ll
never tell a word as long as I live—I swear I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you are not in that boat when I count three, I will
shoot you! One!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace caught hold of the line and drew the boat containing
Merriwell nearer to the yacht. Now he was
weeping outright, shaking with fear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you can’t mean it, Mr. Flynn——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace dropped into the boat. Then Flynn caught the
painter out of Steve’s hand and cast the small boat with its
two human occupants adrift on the tempestuous sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boat drifted away. The yacht swung round, the
wind filled her sails, and away she went into the darkness
of the night.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Walter Wallace wept and wrung his hands, clinging to
the thwarts of the small boat, which was tossed about like
a bit of cork. There was a light on the yacht, and he
strained his eyes toward it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, he can’t mean to leave me this way!” sobbed the
Belfast boy. “He will come back for me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the light grew fainter and fainter as the yacht sped
away. The wind was beginning to howl now, curling the
crest of the rollers up into white caps, now and then tearing
great sheets of water from the waves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dimmer and dimmer grew the light, which showed at
intervals as the little boat rose to the apex of the waves.
Sometimes it could not be seen at all, and then Wallace
groaned, for he still clung to the desperate hope that
Flynn would put about and return to the boat he had cast
adrift.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Belfast boy seemed to forget that he was not alone
in the boat. He prayed and he raved. He expressed
regret that he had ever had anything to do with Flynn.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last, he could see the light no more. Several times
he rose high in the boat as it rolled to the top of a swell
and strained his eyes through the darkness, but was unrewarded.
All around was the dark, swirling sea that
seemed to hiss at him in scorn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lost!” he groaned, sinking down. “The storm is
coming, and this boat must be swamped. It is the end
for me! I am beginning to see that this is just punishment.
I have been a bad boy. I did not know how
bad I really was, but now I can see it all. Oh, if I live I
will reform! I swear it! I will lead a different life!
And Parker Flynn shall be punished!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem to forget that there is anyone else in this
boat,” said the voice of Frank Merriwell, who had remained
quiet so long. “I am in the same box with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace uttered a cry of surprise and joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did forget!” he exclaimed. “Oh, I was thinking of
myself! I am not alone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. You helped get me into this scrape, and now you
are sharing the fun. You do not seem to like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Mr. Merriwell, I am sorry I ever had anything
to do with that man—sorry I ever helped him in his work
against you! It is true, and I hope you will believe me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do,” said Frank, in a dry way. “Almost anybody
in your position would be sorry. But I am tied up here so
I can’t wiggle. Set me free, and we will see what can
be done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, nothing can be done! We are doomed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you can set me free. You need not be afraid
of me now. I’ll not hurt you, for I think you are being
punished enough, and we must be companions for each
other to the end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To the end!” echoed Wallace, as he set at work freeing
Frank. He had a knife, and the task was simple
enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” cried Merry, as he moved his stiffened limbs.
“Oh, what pains! Help me. I am numb all over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace aided him to sit upon one of the seats in the
middle of the boat, and Frank rubbed his arms and legs
to start the circulation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry I helped get you into this scrape, Merriwell,”
said Wallace, feebly. “I hope you will believe me
when I say I had no idea it would come to this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t a doubt of that,” came dryly from Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know what you think, and I do not blame you. You
think I am repentant because I am in the scrape with
you, but I swear I did not dream Flynn was such a desperado.
He said the yacht rightfully belonged to him,
and he induced me to help him run away with it. I
thought that would be the end of it, and, as I had a grudge
against you, I agreed to help him. I was a fool! And
I was sorry an hour after we left Belfast harbor. I have
felt all along that we should be punished for the job. I
hope you will believe me when I say I meant you no
bodily harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I heard your racket with Flynn on the yacht just before
he forced you into the boat, and so I believe you.
Perhaps this experience will teach you a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Little good it will do me, for I’ll not live to profit
by it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s no use to give up. We can’t tell what may
happen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, there’s no chance for us. We are drifting out to
sea, and a storm is coming. We’ll both be drowned before
morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a wave curled over the side of the boat and came
near swamping her. Wallace cried out in fear, but Frank
ripped out a seat and used it as a paddle to aid in holding
the boat steady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take your cap and try to bail out some of that water,”
directed Frank. “We must keep afloat as long as we
can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace obeyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now they could hear a roaring that grew louder and
louder with each passing moment. It was an awesome
sound, and Wallace shuddered and grew sick at heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?” he asked, his voice trembling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be the sea beating on a ledge,” answered
Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Heaven! Then we are being carried straight
upon it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems that way. See if you can tear out another
seat. We must try to paddle past the ledge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry’s companion did his best, but he could not get
out another seat, and the roaring of the water told that
each moment was carrying them nearer and nearer to
the fatal ledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was paddling with all his strength, but the seat
was little better than nothing, and, at times, it took all his
skill to hold the boat steady so she would not upset or be
swamped.</p>

<p class='c010'>The waves tossed them high and then fell away beneath
them, dropping them down with a sickening sensation.
They were drenched with spray and sheets of water. The
wind tore the breath from their lips as it hissed along the
surface of the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steadily and surely they were driven toward the ledge
that lay out there in the night, roaring like an infuriated
wild beast. As they rose on the waves they peered in the
direction of the sound, trying to see where the fatal rock
lay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must strike her soon!” cried Wallace. “The end
will come in a hurry when we do. Oh, dear! oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Not a word from Frank, but he continued to ply his
rude paddle, hoping to pull past the point of danger. He
knew the frail boat would be smashed like an eggshell
if flung on the ledge, but his heart did not fail him. While
he lived he would struggle and hope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There she is!” screamed Wallace, as they rose high on
a great wave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near at hand a wall of foam was flung upward into
the darkness. They saw it a moment, and then it vanished
as they sank into the trough of the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wallace began to pray.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toot! toot! toot!</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the night came the shrill blast of a whistle,
electrifying the imperiled lads. The sound was close
at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that?” screamed Wallace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A whistle—a signal!” came from Frank. “It’s a signal
to us! Answer it! Now—together!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They shouted as loudly as they could. It seemed that
the wind tore the cry from their lips and carried it away
into the night. Again they shouted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toot! toot! toot!</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearer yet sounded the whistle, but they were so close
upon that dreadful ledge!</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the top of a swell they rode, and then they shouted
with joy, for, close at hand, a gleaming light danced over
the surging sea. They knew succor was near. Could it
reach them in time?</p>

<p class='c010'>They continued their cries, and the relentless waves
seemed trying harder than ever to sweep them upon the
ledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once the light seemed to gleam close over them,
and they saw the prow of a boat. They also saw the
face of Jack Diamond close behind a lighted lantern that
he was holding aloft.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here we are!” shouted Frank. “Don’t run us down!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Make ready!” came back the call. “Jump as we swing
alongside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment later the <i>Fox</i> grazed the small boat, and both
lads leaped for their lives. They reached the launch,
clung to her, and she turned and raced away from the
fatal ledge, upon which the waves flung the deserted boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The storm that had risen in the night passed swiftly
with the coming of morning. In the Reach there were
no heavy swells, for the wind had been in the wrong
direction to send a heavy sea rolling in there.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun rose clear just as a small steam launch rounded
the northern end of the Isle au Haut. A mile away to
the northwest a yacht under full sail was making toward
Deer Island.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is the <i>White Wings</i>,” said Frank Merriwell, who
was at the wheel of the <i>Fox</i>, grim determination expressed
on his handsome face. “Those lobster fishermen
told us the truth when they said they had seen her leaving
the island with the first peep of day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a clear course between us,” declared Howard
Dustan, who was studying a chart of the bay. “Hold
straight for her, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge, Diamond and Wallace were also on the launch.
Bart had not been seriously injured in the encounter the
previous night, and he had found a rock to which he could
cling after being flung from the bank into the cove.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Bart was clinging there, the <i>Fox</i> came creeping
back into the cove, and he was taken on board. But Merriwell
had been overcome, and when the boys went to his
rescue they were too late. They saw through the darkness
the boat that was carrying Frank off to the <i>White
Wings</i>. Then they hurried back to the <i>Fox</i>, and backed
out of the cove without delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan explained the disappearance of the launch by
saying that, after Bart and Frank went ashore, they heard
some men talking and knew they were looking for the
launch by circling the shore of the island. As quietly as
possible he and Diamond had pushed the <i>Fox</i> out of the
cove.</p>

<p class='c010'>Knowing Frank was a captive and had been taken on
board the <i>White Wings</i>, the boys ran round the island
in the launch, intending to try to board the yacht and attempt
to rescue Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were surprised to find the yacht under sail. Then
they followed her in the little launch, the light that she
carried enabling them to do so. As they carried no light,
they were not discovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Frank and Wallace were cast adrift the launch
was lying at a distance. It started to follow the yacht,
but Diamond discovered the small boat was gone, and then
he felt certain Frank had been put adrift in her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus it came about that the launch ran out to search
for the small boat, which it found just in time to save
two lives.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now the boys were again after the stolen yacht,
having been aided by some lobster catchers who had seen
the <i>White Wings</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank Merriwell was determined to have revenge and
recover his yacht. He stood at the wheel as Dustan
tended the fire, and the smoke poured from the funnel
of the flying launch.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the wind was light, the launch came up to the <i>White
Wings</i> hand over hand. As they drew near, the sailor,
Steve, was seen at the wheel, while Flynn was watching
them closely.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Flynn could see beyond a doubt that Frank Merriwell
was at the wheel of the pursuing launch, he grew
wildly excited, rushing about the deck and flourishing his
arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s not pleased to see you, Merry,” observed Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t expect he would be,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flynn was seen to rush down the companion way.
Pretty soon he came running on deck, carrying a rifle in
his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of my own guns,” muttered Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is he going to do?” asked Hodge. “Try to
scare us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is desperado enough to attempt anything,” said
Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once Flynn shouted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go back! If you don’t, I’ll fill you full of bullets!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The threat was not heeded, and the man dropped beside
the rail close to the stern of the <i>White Wings</i>. He took
aim with the rifle. Then there was a puff of smoke, and
with a cry Frank dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Dustan could grasp the wheel, however, Merry
was up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I got down just in time, then,” he said, coolly. “I
saw the puff of smoke, and the bullet whistled within
an inch of my head as I fell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out! He may shoot again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! Look! look! The other man is trying to take
the gun away from him! They are fighting!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was true. On the <i>White Wings</i> a struggle was
taking place between the two men. The sailor had deserted
the wheel, and the yacht soon came up into the wind
with her sails fluttering. The main boom swung over and
struck Flynn on the head, knocking him overboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pick the fellow up, somebody,” cried Frank, as the
launch ran alongside the <i>White Wings</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In vain they looked for Parker Flynn. It seemed that
he sank as soon as he struck the water, and his body was
not recovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other man made no resistance as they came on
board the yacht.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I kept the critter from doin’ any more shootin’,” he
said. “I’ve had enough of his style of business. I s’pose
I’ll have to go to the jug for havin’ anything at all ter
do with him, but I’ll take my med’cine.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c010'>At sunset that very day the <i>White Wings</i> sailed into
Belfast harbor and reached her old anchorage. Browning
had been on the watch, and, with Hans, he put off in
a boat before the yacht was abreast the steamboat wharf.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you need any shore detectives, Merriwell,”
he said. “You have robbed me of the fun of taking
part in the chase, and I’ll have to lay that up against you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yaw,” cried Hans, “he vill haf to laid dot up against
you, Vrankie. You vos glat I got pack, ain’d id? Der
Pelfast girls vos afrait they vould nefer seen you some
more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dustan had allowed the yacht to precede him into the
harbor, but now he came running in with Wallace and
Steve, the sailor, on board. When he reached the wharf
the latter made a break for liberty, and he succeeded in
getting away. It is possible that Merriwell did not push
the pursuit as closely as he might. He had other plans
afoot, anyway, for he intended to go on a fishing trip to
Lake Sebasticook, and the preparations for this took up
all his time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>FISHING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The morning sunshine lay like shining silver on the
placid bosom of beautiful Lake Sebasticook. Not a cloud
hung in the blue sky, and it was a perfect summer morning,
for the sun was not yet high enough to make the air
uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near the mouth of a stream that empties into the northern
end of the lake floated a canoe that contained two
persons who were fishing. The occupants of the canoe
were Frank Merriwell and Bart Hodge. In the bottom of
the canoe lay more than a dozen large white perch, glittering
in the sunlight. That they were a fresh catch was
evident, for they had not lost their silvery luster, and occasionally
some of them flopped about in a frantic endeavor
to get back into the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, they are beauties!” cried Hodge, as he gazed
at them in admiration; “and we did rope them in fast for
a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what we did,” nodded Frank. “I wonder why
they stopped biting so suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know. What are those splashes on the water
over that way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know!” exclaimed Frank, suddenly beginning to
reel in his line with great swiftness. “Pull in, Hodge—pull
in!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t ask questions! Pull in!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart obeyed, and the boys quickly reeled their lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” said Frank, catching a paddle, “to get on the
farther side of those splashes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” came from Hodge, as he got into position
for using his paddle, kneeling in the canoe. “Here we
go!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The thin blades dipped and rose from the water, flashing
in the sunshine. They plied the paddles with regularity
and skill, making not the least splashing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank steered, and he set a course that surprised Bart,
who asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Round that splashing,” was the answer. “We want to
get on the farther side.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why are we going round?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To get ahead of those fish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not go straight through?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We might divide the school, or cause the fish to sink.
Those are the perch we struck a short time ago. A few
of them were jumping then, and now the whole school
is near the surface. Those fish are making for a feeding
ground.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a short time they passed round the school and lay
before them.</p>

<p class='c010'>With great haste, Frank unreeled his line, baited his
hook and flung it far from him. Hodge followed his
example, but did not let the hook sink far before, seeing
a great splashing in another direction, he began to pull in.
He had not drawn the hook far before something took
it with a jerk and darted away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great Scott!” cried Hodge, excitedly. “What a bite!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pull him in!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge obeyed, and the fish darted from side to side, the
line cutting into Bart’s fingers with the fierce plunges of
the finny fellow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the side of the canoe Hodge pulled the fish. The
bright sunshine showed something white that darted and
plunged in a mad endeavor to break away, and then, at
the last moment, seemed to give up exhausted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, being able to see the fish plainly, Hodge stopped,
uttering a gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Merry?” he asked, in a flutter. “It can’t
be a white perch, for it’s too big.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pull it in, and then we’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Bart had slackened at the wrong time, and now the
great fish gave a flop and escaped from the hook. There
was a flash of silver plunging downward, and the fish
was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart was exasperated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a stupid fellow I am!” he growled. “But that
fish was so big! He was too large for a perch, and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was drawing in his line to give it another throw.
All at once, it gave a jerk and slipped through his fingers,
then he began to pull away hand over hand, while
the line cut here and there through the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have one!” cried Bart, excitedly. “Don’t let
him get away as I did, Merry! Jingoes! but he is doing
some fancy dodging!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the surface darted the fish and up into the air
he leaped like a flash of light out of the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” shouted Hodge, starting to rise in his excitement.
“What a dandy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get down!” commanded Frank, quickly. “You will
have this canoe bottom up if you do that again! It’s a
wonder you didn’t turn her over then!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so,” agreed Bart, who was familiar with the
cranky tricks of canoes; “but I couldn’t keep still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the canoe Frank pulled his catch, and both lads
stared at the fish, for it was larger than four of the
large ones of their first lot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can that be a white perch?” gurgled Hodge, amazed.
“It doesn’t look just like the others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whatever it is, there are more out there,” said Frank.
“Get after them, Bart. We’ll daze the fellows when we
bring in a mess of these dandies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge had arranged a tempting bait on his hook, and
now he made a fancy throw that carried the whole length
of the line out of the boat. The hook struck far away
on the water and sank, while the fish Frank had caught
flopped in the bottom of the canoe, stirring up the others
to a merry, pattering dance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pull in by the time your hook sinks three or four
feet,” said Frank, looking after his own bait. “These big
fellows are on the surface.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart obeyed, and he had not drawn his hook a third of
the way to the canoe before it was snapped up, bringing
a little cry of satisfaction from his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, this is sport!” he exclaimed. “I thought we had
fun with those little fellows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those little fellows!” laughed Frank. “A short time
ago you were calling them beauties.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They seemed so then, but these are so much larger—no
you don’t, old chap!—and they are so much whiter!
I hope we can get a big mess of them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Bart snapped into the boat a fish quite as large
as the one Merriwell had caught. He held the shining
beauty up and feasted his eyes on the spectacle a moment.
Then the hook was removed, and the fish was tossed down
to help stir up his gasping comrades.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time Frank had hooked another, and for fifteen
minutes the fun was fast and furious. Once they were
forced to pick up the paddles and get ahead of the school
again; but finally, with amazing suddenness, the fish ceased
biting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where have they gone?” asked Bart. “I can’t see
them jumping anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor I,” said Frank. “They have sunk. Let your line
drop deeper before starting to pull in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But, although they tried various methods of fishing,
they caught but two or three more, and those were not
large ones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are gone,” said Frank, regretfully; “but we have
made a fine haul, Hodge. Won’t Browning kick himself,
to think he did not get up and come with me when I
awoke him this morning!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He won’t get over it all day, for he’d rather fish than
do anything else—unless it’s sleep. It’s wonderful how
lazy that fellow is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he can fight. He’s got so he wants to fight my
battles now. Why, he was going to dip in over at Camp
Benson last night when that fellow, Welch, from Newport,
took a fancy to punch me for dancing with his girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He told me about it, and he said Welch was backed
by a big, bewhiskered ruffian who was all ready to hit
you from behind. That was why he got into the game.
It was a plain case of a crooked attempt to do you up, but
Browning spoiled the trick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw the man, and I was on guard for him. Welch
swore he’d do me, and he’s just the kind of fellow who
will try to keep his word. He is a ruffian, but is cowardly.
I do not believe he would hesitate to kill a man if he was
in a rage and thought he might escape punishment
for——”</p>

<p class='c010'>The report of a gun reached their ears, and, at the
same moment, something came rattling against the side
of the canoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge uttered a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m shot!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>A curl of white smoke was rising above some water
reeds, plainly showing where the gun had been fired.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge held up his hand, and there was blood on his
wrist. He wiped it away, and then picked a shot from
under the skin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank had felt several shot strike his clothes, but evidently
they were too far spent to penetrate far.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all infernal carelessness!” grated Hodge, his face
dark with anger. “I never heard of anything like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It could not have been carelessness!” cried Frank.
“Here we are in plain view out in the open water. The
person who fired that shot must have seen us. If it was
carelessness, it was criminal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you hit, Merry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of the shot struck my clothes, but none of them
reached my body, I think. How much are you hurt,
Bart?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much, but I’m mad enough to thump the chump
who fired that shot! I’d like the job!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell had reeled in his line, and now he swiftly
drew in Bart’s. Then he caught up his paddle and sent
the head of the canoe round toward the point where the
puff of smoke had been seen rising above the water reeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll soon find out who did the shooting,” came grimly
from his lips, as he sent the light craft forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart caught up his paddle, and soon the canoe was literally
skimming along the silvery surface of the lake.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they approached the rushes there were signs of commotion
behind them. A head bobbed up and disappeared
from view, and then a boat was thrust slowly out. It
contained two persons, who seemed inclined to row away,
but changed their minds when they beheld how close upon
them the canoe was. They turned about and desperately
faced the boys.</p>

<p class='c010'>One was a man of middle age, roughly dressed, with a
wide-brimmed hat set upon one side of his head and
long-legged rubber boots on his feet. He wore a full
beard, and his hair was long enough to fall on the collar
of his coat. The face was that of a hard-drinking man,
and his manner indicated that he was a reckless ruffian.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other was a youth of eighteen or nineteen, with
square shoulders and a sullen face. He, also, looked like
a desperado, and yet, there was something about him that
might prove attractive and fascinating for a thoughtless,
romantic girl. He was dressed in a careless manner, in
plain clothes, but somehow those clothes seemed to set
upon him in a way that showed him to advantage. In fact,
they actually made him look more attractive than better
and more fashionable garments could.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as Merriwell saw these two persons, he softly
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hello! So those are the chaps?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know them?” asked Hodge, quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should guess yes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Welch and his backer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What—the fellow who wanted to thrash you over at
Camp Benson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. And the man is the one who was looking for a
chance to dip into the row. Now, I am beginning to think
this shooting was not accidental.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man and the boy glared at Frank and Bart, but
said not a word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who fired that shot?” demanded Merriwell, holding
his paddle in the water so that it would slacken the forward
motion of the canoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are you talkin’ to?” demanded Welch, surlily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am talking to you, sir! Who fired that shot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What shot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The one a few moments ago.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! what are you drivin’ at? We don’t know nothin’
about no shot. You make me tired!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That kind of bluff will not go. One of you fired a shot
from behind these reeds a few minutes ago. Who did it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man regarded the boys with the utmost contempt,
seemingly quite indifferent, but Welch grew red with
anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say!” he cried; “you’re too fresh, Mr. Frank Merriwell!
I know you! Because you are a college chap and
have had your name printed in the papers, you think you
can come down here into Maine and run over the countrymen
you find here. Well, you will find out the countrymen
won’t be run over. I don’t believe you are such a
much, anyway. What you really need is a good thumping,
and I’d like the job to give it to you. I’d done it
yesterday if it hadn’t been for that big lummuxing chum
of yours who meddled in. I’ll do it yet when I get the
chance! I promise you that I will thump you, and Jim
Welch always keeps his promises. Now, you chaps had
better git!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very amusing, Mr. Jim Welch,” he declared.
“It is evident that you think yourself a dangerous sort of
individual, but you are dangerous only when you have
a shotgun in your hands and are hidden behind some reeds.
It would be just like you to try to shoot somebody in the
back. Your face shows that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t shoot at all, and you don’t want to say I did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then your friend did!” cried Hodge, who was fairly
quivering for trouble. “His face shows he wouldn’t hesitate
to——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, confound you!” growled the man, scowling
at Hodge; “you want to go slow! Neither of us did
any shooting, for we ain’t got anything to shoot with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No guns?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it don’t make a bit of difference whether you believe
it or not. You’re nothing but kids, and we can’t fool
with you. Come, Welch, if we’re going to get any fishing
this morning we must get started. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He placed the oars in the rowlocks and got into position
for rowing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What were you doing in there behind those reeds?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is none of your business!” shouted Welch. “Now,
you chaps want to get out of the way, or you’ll get into
trouble, for we won’t fool with ye!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He lifted an oar threateningly, but the canoe was beyond
his reach, and so he sat down, after half rising to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take your paddle out of the water, Bart,” whispered
Frank. “I’m going to have a look into their boat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge obeyed, and then, with a single, long, quick
stroke, Merriwell whirled the canoe up beside the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing?” growled the startled man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We want to see your guns,” said Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To blazes with you! I told you we had no guns, and
you can see for yourselves. Do you see any guns?”</p>

<p class='c010'>To Bart’s surprise, not a gun was to be seen in the boat.
In the bottom, at one end, however, lay a pile of rushes,
such as are sometimes bound on the front end of a boat
when it creeps upon water birds, for the occupants of the
boat to obtain a shot. Of a sudden, Frank leaned over
and gave those reeds a yank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two shotguns were exposed to view!</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge gave a cry of triumph and anger, and Frank,
with another sudden twist of his paddle, tried to back the
canoe away from the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man uttered a cry of anger, and Welch leaped to
his feet, catching up an oar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’ll fix you!” he shouted, swinging the oar over
his head and striking straight at Frank’s head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry saw he could not get out of reach, and so, in a
moment, he swung his paddle out of water and used it to
divert the oar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crack!—the oar struck the paddle and was turned aside.
Frank had saved his skull from being cracked by his swift
move.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a great splash, the oar struck in the water, and
Welch was given a yank that set him toppling, in a frantic
effort not to plunge headlong out of the boat. He let go
of the oar and flung up his hands, waving them wildly,
and then, finding he must go over, he dropped and caught
at the side of the boat, overturning that in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>It happened in a moment. Both Welch and his companion
were precipitated into the water. The man disappeared
a few seconds, and then came up and grasped the
end of the boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch went down, came to the surface, thrust his hands
up into the air, cried out gurglingly, splashed a moment,
and went down again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The commotion in the water caused the canoe to rock,
but Bart Hodge laughed shortly. His face showed
triumph and satisfaction at the misfortune that had befallen
the man and boy. With his paddle, he moved the
canoe yet farther away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell looked somewhat anxious and waited for
Welch to come to the surface again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man, clinging to the overturned boat, poured forth
a torrent of angry abuse at the boys in the canoe, neither
of whom paid any attention to him. Had they done so,
they would have observed that he felt of his beard and
hair in a singular manner, as if doubtful about something.</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch came up again, splashed about, strangled,
coughed, cried out and sank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately Frank began to take off some of his
clothing. He flung his cap into the bottom of the canoe,
his coat followed it, and then he pulled off his shoes, keeping
low down, so that he would not overturn the birch-bark
craft.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you going to do, Frank?” asked Bart, surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Save that fellow from drowning, if I can. He can’t
swim.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what is the use to jump into the water and get
wet? We can get near him as he comes up, and one of
us can catch hold of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you see, he is drowning! He would clutch the
canoe—try to drag himself out of the water—overturn
it instantly! We’d both get a wetting, when one can——There
he is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch came up again. His struggles were feebler, and
he gasped for breath with a painful sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell half lifted himself. The canoe began to
rock, and Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t dive over without upsetting me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking hold of the frail craft in a certain manner,
Merry lifted himself with both hands, and swung himself
fairly over the stern end. Had he gone over the side, he
must have overturned the canoe, but he dropped into the
water with a splash, and the light craft remained upright.
It was a skillful trick, and it astonished Hodge, who was
more than half expecting to be capsized.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Frank struck the water, Welch sank again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s gone down, Merry!” cried Bart.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank struck out with powerful strokes, reached the
spot where Welch had disappeared, and then dived beneath
the surface.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man who was clinging to the overturned boat had
begun to swim, pushing it toward the shore, some distance
below the mass of water reeds behind which they had been
concealed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge paid no attention to boat or man, but he waited
with the greatest anxiety for Frank to come to the surface.
With the paddle, he moved the canoe somewhat
nearer the spot where Merry had dived beneath the
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank came up directly, and he had a hold upon the
drowning lad, but Welch had twisted his legs about Frank
with a grip that hampered Frank’s movements. In vain
Merry tried to break away. It seemed that Welch had
fastened upon him with a death grip.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can I help you?” asked Hodge, anxiously, as he saw
Merry struggling in the water, sometimes sinking beneath
the surface. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This fellow—has—his legs—twisted about mine!”
panted Frank. “Confound him! He wants to drown us
both!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart worked nearer with the canoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hit him on the head, Frank!” he cried. “Hit him
quick and hard! Don’t let him pull you under like that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Merry fought till he broke away from the half-unconscious
Welch, which caused him to utter an exclamation
of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m all right now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you get him ashore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I will keep close, so that I can give you some
help, if you need it. Don’t drown yourself trying to
save him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must save him, Hodge,” said Frank, as he swam
toward the distant beach, supporting Welch. “It would
not do for us to let him drown after——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“After he tried to shoot us!” grated Bart. “Oh, that
is like you, Merriwell! You are ready to risk your own
life for an enemy who has done you any kind of injury!
I’m not built that way! My enemies can look out for
themselves!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank said nothing, for he was thoroughly occupied in
the task of reaching the shore, and he could make but
slow progress, burdened as he was.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge paddled along, watching Frank anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me hold the fellow’s head above the surface a few
moments, while you rest, Frank,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Merry. “Can’t take chances of his overturning
you. I’m all right. Keep on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the boat was now so close to the shore
that he could touch bottom. He stood up and waded out,
pushing the boat along and dragging it up on the beach.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having done this, the fellow turned and looked at the
approaching lads. He seemed undecided for a moment,
but suddenly wheeled about and plunged into the swampy
woods, vanishing from view.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge saw this movement, and wondered at it, but
said nothing to Merriwell, feeling that Frank needed to
give his entire attention to the task of getting ashore with
Welch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearer and nearer to the shore Merriwell struggled.
He moved slower and slower, and it was plain that the
task was a heavy drain upon his energy and endurance.
Bart feared that Frank would give out, but this did not
happen. Finally Hodge said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you can stand up here, Merry. Try it—see if
your feet will touch bottom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank did so, and found he could touch the bottom and
have his head out of the water, which enabled him to walk
ashore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart got out upon the beach and helped Frank drag
Welch upon the sand. Merriwell was panting, but he
regarded with the greatest anxiety the lad he had brought
to land.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s drowned!” cried Hodge. “He is done for,
Frank!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Off with your coat!” exclaimed Merriwell, panting.
“Give me my coat and shoes from the canoe. Quick!
We must hustle if we bring him round!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking the shoes, Frank wrapped the coat about them,
making a hard roll or bundle. Then he placed the bundle
on the beach, and, aided by Bart, lay Welch, face down,
upon it so it pressed upon his stomach. Having placed
the unconscious lad in this position, with the collar of his
shirt ripped open, Merriwell began pressing upon his
back just below his shoulder blades, and with each pressure
water spurted from the lad’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If we can get him to breathing after we get this water
out of him, he’ll come round,” said Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>They did not work more than a minute before Welch
choked and groaned, causing Frank to express relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s coming round so quick,” said Merry. “We’ll
have him all right in short order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Welch groaned and choked in a most distressing
manner. The boys knew he was suffering fearful tortures,
but they kept at work till he ceased to expel water.
Then Frank placed him in a position to breathe easily,
and they saw him staring up at them with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are all right,” said Merry; “but it was a close
shave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” groaned Welch; “I’d rather die than go through
that again! How did I get here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You got here by being brought by Frank Merriwell,”
said Hodge, scowling at Welch. “He risked his life to
save you from drowning, and you didn’t deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch said nothing for some moments, but seemed trying
to collect his scattered wits. At last he asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Bunker?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The man you were with?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He skipped into the swamp somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And left me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. He got ashore first, and he——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will do!” growled a hoarse voice, and there was
a grating step on the sand. “Bunker is here. He don’t
run away from kids like you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man approached, carrying a heavy club in his
hand. He looked ugly enough at that moment, and it was
plain he was not in a pleasant mood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look out for him, Frank!” whispered Hodge. “He is
up to something.”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>HELD AT BAY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Bunker halted and glared at the boys. His clothes were
dripping wet, and his long hair clung about his neck. At
that moment he was an ugly looking individual.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You youngsters have had lots of sport this morning,
haven’t you!” he snarled. “Well, you shall pay for it,
and pay dearly, too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You or your friend here started the ball rolling,” said
Frank, quietly. “You filled the side of our canoe with
shot, and wounded Mr. Hodge in the wrist. It was fortunate
for us that you did not do greater damage. And it
is fortunate for you that, after what you did do, you have
got off so easily.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge was not saying a word, but he was watching the
man closely. The look on Bart’s face told that he thoroughly
despised Bunker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you crow pretty loud for kids!” grated the fellow.
“What you need is to have some of the conceit taken out
of you. Welch says you have had your name in print
so often and been talked about so much that you’ve got
the swelled head. You think yourself the smartest chap
alive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter what I think, that is no excuse for your
criminal carelessness in shooting toward us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It wasn’t carelessness, Merry!” exclaimed Bart, unable
to keep still longer. “It was criminal design!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If one of us shot toward you, it was an accident,”
growled the man. “But now you have an account to
settle with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what is it?” asked Frank, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You upset us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s not true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you caused us to lose our guns.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You denied that you had any guns in the boat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That makes no difference. Now, I want you to pay
for those guns.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You bet I do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that is nerve!” laughed Merry, his eyes flashing.
“After you overturned your own boat in the attempt
to break my head, you expect us to pay for the guns
you lost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are responsible, and you’ll have to pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is another opinion about that. You and Mr.
Welch are responsible for everything that has occurred
between us. Had not Welch tried to break my head with
an oar, you would not have capsized and lost your guns.
That being the case, you cannot expect us to pay for
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To the man, Frank seemed very mild and quiet, and this
encouraged Bunker, who fancied it would not be difficult
to scare him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do expect you to pay for them!” shouted the man,
fiercely; “and you will, too!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, we will not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Still, Merriwell was not in the least excited. He even
smiled serenely into the face of the water-soaked, angry
man. As he did so, he unbuttoned the sleeves of his shirt
and began to roll them back. Two round, white arms,
shining with dampness, were exposed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker gave a snarl of anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you fool!” he cried. “Do you think you can
scare me by rolling up your sleeves? I’ll take you over
my knee and spank you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This caused Merriwell’s smile to broaden and break into
a ringing laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just toss aside that club,” he said, “and I’ll soon show
you who will be spanked.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t do it, Bill!” came from Welch, who had recovered
in a remarkable manner. “He is the greatest athlete
in Yale College, if what the papers say about him is
true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ain’t going to fool with him,” declared Bunker, advancing
a step and half lifting the club. “Pay for those
guns, Mr. Frank Merriwell, or I’ll thump the life out of
you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank stood his ground, looking the man straight in
the eyes; but Hodge retreated to the canoe, the prow of
which had been drawn up on the sand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep back!” commanded Merriwell. “We are not
going to fool with you any longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I am not going to fool with you, either!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have tried to fill us with shot and break our
heads this morning. That you have received the worst
of it so far is simple retribution. Welch would have
drowned if I hadn’t saved him, for you made no move
to help him. You owe me something for that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bah! You saved him because you were afraid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That, if he died, you would be held responsible. It
was cowardice, not bravery, that led you to get him out
of the water.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are at liberty to think that, if you like; it makes
no difference to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. I pulled him out, just the same, and we
pumped the water out of him after getting him ashore.
You were not on hand to help, and he would be dead
past resuscitation at this moment had he depended on
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker advanced another step.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It makes no difference,” he grated; “you’ll pay for
the guns, just the same—and for the oars, too. I want
twenty dollars for my gun, and Jim’s was worth fifteen.
The oars bring it up to—well, you can cough up fifty
dollars, and we’ll call it square.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How kind!” laughed Merriwell. “My dear sir, we
could not think of accommodating you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll have to, or I’ll crack your skull sure this
time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the club was flourished threateningly, and the
face of the man showed he really meant it. Frank grew
grave, but did not take his eyes from the ruffian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, Mr. Bunker,” he said, swiftly, “you are
getting yourself into a bad scrape. If you don’t drop
it, I’ll take the trouble to swear out a warrant for you at
the earliest opportunity and place an officer on your track.
It will not be difficult to put you behind iron bars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bah!” again cried the man. “You can’t save yourself
that way. Cough up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a cent!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you get it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank fell into a defensive attitude, and Bunker swung
the club aloft, starting to make a spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The word rang out like a shot. It came from the lips
of Bart Hodge, who was standing just behind Frank,
having picked a small rifle out of the canoe. The weapon
was at Bart’s shoulder, and its muzzle covered Bunker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!” repeated Hodge. “If you make another move,
I’ll send a twenty-two into your head! It won’t make a
large hole, but it will do some damage, even to a wooden
head, like yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker halted, for he saw that Hodge was in deadly
earnest, and the rifle, small though it was, was not exactly
pleasant to look upon just then.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You fool!” panted the man. “You wouldn’t dare!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, I would!” grated Hodge. “I’d like to do it!
It would give me great satisfaction, but I thought it best
to give you fair warning first. Drop that club!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker hesitated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drop it!” flashed Bart. “Drop it, or I’ll drop you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man let the club fall on the sand, and then he
laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you chaps have more sand than I thought,” he
said. “I was trying you—that’s all. Of course, I didn’t
mean to do you any harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! of course not,” said Merriwell, with sarcasm.
“You are one of the most harmless chaps in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t think we’re fools,” snapped Hodge. “We
stopped your little game, that’s all. Now, git.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, go,” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the boat—Welch——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boat is all right. Take a walk along the shore—lively.
Don’t turn round till you are out of range
of this rifle, for you may encounter a bullet if you do.
That’s all. Go on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But—but——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are no buts about it. Go this instant, or Hodge
will salt you. Get a move on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man turned about and walked away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” said Frank, speaking to Welch, “I advise you
to have nothing more to do with that chap. He’ll get you
into some bad scrape if you do. You are lucky to get
off this time so easily. I have no particular grudge
against you, even though you did want to thump me for
dancing with a certain young lady at Camp Benson yesterday.
But don’t monkey round me in the future, for I
don’t always overlook things this way. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge had pushed the canoe into the water, and now
they entered it and pushed off from the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s lucky I brought this rifle along,” said Hodge, as
he placed it in the bow and picked up his paddle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had forgotten you had it,” confessed Frank. “It did
come in handy, that is a fact.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time Bunker knew what had happened behind
him, they were a long distance from the shore, skimming
swiftly away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>WAKING UP HANS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>A column of blue smoke was rising above the trees
on Sandy Point as the canoe containing Merriwell and
Hodge drew up to the wide beach, on which lay three
more inverted canoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the canoe touched the sand there was a whoop
from the woods, and Hans Dunnerwust, stripped of the
last rag of clothing, came bursting into view, made a wild
run for the water, as if he were to plunge in headlong,
stopped short when his toes were wet, and backed off, lifting
his feet into the air and shaking them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” he gurgled. “Dot peen a narrow
escapes. Dot vawter peen too vet vor you to took a
path indo, ain’d id? Vot peen der use to took a path,
anyvay? Id gits a veller all ofer vet, und id vos drouple
to dry yourseluf. Yaw. I dook a path ven I vos ad
Vardale, for der horneds shased me der prook indo. Dot
peen goot enough to last you till next summer. Oxcuse
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, with great gravity, not even looking at Frank
and Bart, he turned about, walked up the beach and disappeared
into the bushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” laughed Merry, “Hans certainly came very
near taking a voluntary bath that time. He stopped just
in time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Browning has been guying him again,” said Bart.
“I heard him ask Hans yesterday if this was not his year
to take a bath.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank cut some forked branches from the bushes near,
and soon the white perch were strung upon them. The
large fish were arranged on the outside of the strings, so
they made a handsome showing. Taking care of the
canoe and dipping the fish in the water, so they again
glistened like silver, the boys started toward the cottage,
which they were occupying on the point.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a path to the cottage, and this they followed.
As they approached, the door of the cottage was seen
standing wide open, and Bruce Browning was heard
laughing heartily within. Diamond was carrying in an
armful of wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ha! ha! ha!” roared Bruce. “You are in danger,
Hans, for you say you got your toes wet. You’ll be ill,
sure. Just think what a horrible thing it is to put wet
water right onto a person’s skin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot’s der madder mit you!” squawked the voice of
Hans. “You und Shack peen oud und done dot a liddle
vile ago, don’d id? You kept bokin’ vun ad me till I got
me my glothing oudt und vent oudt to took a path, but I
vound der vawter too vet this mornings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes; the water is wet. I never saw a Dutchman
who wasn’t afraid of real wet water. They don’t even
want to drink it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, dot vasn’t no skin off you somevere, vos id?
Vot peen der madder?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Frank and Bart mounted the steps and walked
into the cottage, carrying the handsome fish they had
caught.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were cries of astonishment and surprise from the
three lads.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye gods!” burst from Browning. “What have you
been doing, fellows?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Catching fish,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Veesh?” squawked Hans, who was putting on his shirt.
“Vale, I should said so! Vere vos dose veesh caught
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove!” exclaimed Diamond, his eyes shining.
“Those are beauties! I didn’t suppose there were such
fish in this lake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor I,” groaned Browning. “If I had, I’d turned out
when Merriwell called me this morning. What sport you
must have had!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We caught them,” said Merry; “now, if you want
some for breakfast, clean them and cook them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know much about cleaning fish,” said the big
Yale man. “I’d rather catch them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So had I,” nodded Diamond; “but I didn’t catch them,
so I am willing to clean my share.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Und I vill cook them,” said Hans. “I pet more as
eight or nine uf dose veesh can ead me this morning. I
vos awful hongry since I took dot path.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the fish were taken from the string and laid out
to be admired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a fellow that will weigh more than two
pounds,” said Jack, pointing out a handsome perch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And here is one larger than that,” said Merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s simply wonderful!” grunted Bruce. “Look at the
difference between that big fellow and this one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He picked up one of the smallest fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hans could not keep his eyes off the perch, although he
was hastening to dress. He crowded in with the others
as he drew on his trousers and drew his suspenders up
over his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I do lofe peautiful veesh,” he gurgled. “They
vos goot food to ead your prain vor. I alvays ead veesh
ven I can got them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That explains why you have such a remarkable brain,”
observed Browning, as he dropped the small perch down
the Dutch lad’s back, thrusting it inside the collar of his
shirt, which was not buttoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the cold, clammy fish slipped down his back, Hans
gave a wild howl and leaped into the air, giving a twist of
his body and making a frantic effort to reach over his
shoulder and catch hold of the perch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wow!” he whooped. “Vot id vos, aind id? Hellup.
Vos I struck lightnin’s py? Ye-e-e-ow! Got dot out uf
my pack off! Kvick! Shimminy Gristmas! I pet zwei
tollars dot vos a snake grawlin’ your pack down! Take
it avay!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He nearly turned himself wrongside out in his convulsive
efforts. The fish slipped still farther down his back
and finally got into the left leg of his trousers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye-e-e-eh!” squealed the fat Dutch lad, dancing around
the room on his right foot and kicking out with the other.
“Dot snake peen comin’ down your drowsers legs! Got
a club und kill me kvick! Don’d let me got avay!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boys had seen Browning’s act, and they were convulsed
with laughter at the antics of the frightened Dutch
lad.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep still, Hans,” said Frank. “If it is a snake, you
will make him bite you all the quicker by hopping around
that way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t kept still!” shouted Hans. “Dot snake is
grawling der leg uf my drowsers town alretty! I vos
so coldt efry dime I touch myseluf to him dot it gives you
der shifers! Oh? Wow! Ye-ow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hans gave a great wiggle and kick, and out
dropped the little fish onto the floor. The Dutch lad
gasped in astonishment and stared at the fish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vos dot der snake?” he muttered, huskily, his face
very pale, despite his exertions. “Vale, dot peen der
vunniest snake you efer seen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be a water snake,” said Merriwell, laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vot you vant to knew is how dot veesh got down der
pack uf my neck. I don’t seen some vings on heem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was trying to hide, so you wouldn’t cook him,” said
Browning. “That’s all, Hans. Don’t blame the poor
fish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vale, he don’d blay dot me onto again. He near scat
uf me der life out. Yaw!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond took some of the finest perch outside, and,
finding a board, carried them down to the water, where he
cleaned them. In a short time they were frying in the
pan, giving out a delicious odor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>OFFICERS OF THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>It was a jolly party that gathered about the breakfast
table in that little cottage on Sandy Point. The fish were
cooked brown and crisp, the coffee was delicious, and
everything tasted good. They laughed and joked as
they ate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell and Hodge had told all about their encounter
with Bunker and Welch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must look out for those fellows,” said Diamond.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe they will trouble us again,” declared
Browning. “Welch would have no sense of gratitude if
he did after Merriwell saved him from drowning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he is a fellow who has any sense of
gratitude,” came from Hodge; “and his face shows he
is a hard drinker. I believe the man can lead him
into anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I don’t know about that,” said Frank. “He did
not take any part in Bunker’s attempted attack on us
after I got him out of the water. That shows——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” cut in Bart. “He was pretty well used
up, and he did not have the nerve to take any part in
that little affair. I think that fellow is thoroughly bad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be too hard on him, old man,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, see if I am not right. You’re always trying to
discover good qualities in everybody. You do not seem
to believe any person can be thoroughly bad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is right,” nodded Frank; “I do not believe anybody
can be entirely bad. I am firmly convinced that
even the worst ruffian has some redeeming qualities.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, but it makes me tired when you put
so much confidence in rascals who are doing everything
possible to injure you. Some time you will get done up
for keeps by some ruffian you are trying to befriend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps so. I’ll chance it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Breakfast over, Browning threw himself down on one
of the beds and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There,” he said, with a sigh of satisfaction, “now I
could go to sleep again, and I wouldn’t need any
rocking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gif me a shiggerette, Pruce,” said Hans. “Id makes
you vant to smoke ven I haf von.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Confound your cigarettes!” cried Diamond. “I wish
you wouldn’t smoke them! When a fellow had such a
hard time to leave off as I did, it’s a big temptation to
see others smoking and to smell them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re not obliged to see me,” grunted Bruce. “You
can go outside. There’s nobody round to bother you
out——”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sound of feet on the steps, and two men
entered the cottage. They were large, determined-looking
fellows, plainly dressed. They stopped just inside
the door and looked the party over, without speaking a
word.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, gentlemen,” said Merriwell. “This
visit is something of a surprise. You’re a little late for
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The larger of the two men nodded shortly, then he
turned to the other and said something in a low tone.
Their actions aroused Bart’s suspicions, and he took a
step toward the corner, where two shotguns stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is this the whole of your party?” asked the large man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is,” answered Frank. “What can we do for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man did not answer at once, but he was heard to
say to the other:</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ain’t here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps they’re lyin’,” muttered the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here,” came grimly from the big man; “we’re
looking for a certain person, and we have been told he
was camping out over this way with a lot of boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank flushed a bit and stepped forward promptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no person camping here besides the ones you
see,” came rather sharply from his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>More words passed between the two men, and then the
larger one said aloud:</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you’re lyin’, you’ll get yourselves inter trouble. I
am Ben Bowers, the sheriff from Newport. This is John
Nason, one of my deputies. We are here looking after a
certain chap who has been passing in this section under
the name of Joe Tweed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We know nothing of Mr. Joe Tweed. We never
heard of him, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right. You look as if you was honest, but,
perhaps, you don’t know what this Tweed has done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he’s robbed an old miser, over in North Newport,
of thirty thousand dollars, and hit the old man a
crack on the head that may kill him. Now, if you’ve seen
Tweed, or know anything about him, the best thing you
can do is to tell everything. You’ll git in a bad scrape if
you don’t, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time Frank was thoroughly angry, but he held
himself in check, seeming perfectly cool, although he
spoke firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are not robbers, Mr. Sheriff, and we do not associate
with robbers. Such an insinuation is decidedly unpleasant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps they’ve seen him,” said the deputy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart strode to Frank’s side and said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who knows—this chap who calls himself Bunker may
be the fellow they are looking after.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank gave a start. Then he asked:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does this Joe Tweed look like, Mr. Bowers?
Will you describe him, please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a large man, dresses pretty well, smooth-faced,
looks like an actor. He is a very smooth talker. Has a
small, blue scar under his left ear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bart was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bunker’s not the man,” he said, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have seen no such man as you describe,” declared
Merriwell. “He has not been here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s strange,” declared the sheriff. “Proctor said he
saw him around here yesterday afternoon. Proctor was
coming over from Turner’s about the middle of the afternoon,
and, as he was running past this point, he said he
saw Tweed come out of the woods. When Tweed saw
Proctor’s boat, he turned round and made into the bushes
in a hurry. That looks as if he had some sort of hiding
place round here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With the exception of Hans, we were all over to Camp
Benson yesterday afternoon. Hans was here alone. Did
you see anybody prowling around here yesterday, Hans?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shimminy Gristmas!” gurgled Hans, turning pale.
“You pet I didn’d seen nopodys! Uf I knew nopodys
vos browling around here, I vould been so scat dot you
vould had heart vailure! Und id vos a roppers? Py
Chorch! you don’d got me to stayed here some more all
alone myseluf by!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Dutch lad’s fear and excitement was genuine, and
it impressed the men more than anything Merriwell had
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” observed the sheriff, “if you know nothing
about him, you will not be able to help us in any way.
We thought it possible he had managed to get you to take
him in with you some way, even if he was not one of your
party originally. Keep your eyes open for him. There
is a reward of five hundred dollars offered for his capture
already. If you could help us nab him, it would be
worth your while. That’s all. Sorry to have disturbed
you. Must be going. Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he turned and, followed by the deputy, left the
cottage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell was interested now, and he followed the
officers out, asking them several questions about Joe
Tweed, the robber. He learned that Tweed had been
hanging around Newport for some time, but had not been
seen there for several days. He had made many acquaintances
in the village at the foot of the lake, and had
found out all about Peter Small, the miser. It was
thought in Newport that Tweed had been assisted by some
person who lived in that vicinity, for the manner in which
he had entered Small’s house and found the old man’s
hidden hoard of money, after half killing the miser,
showed he was well informed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank, Bart and Jack accompanied the officers down
to the shore, where a small sailboat lay. With the boat
they had run over from Turner’s, and they said they
were going on to Proctor’s, the wind being favorable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boys saw them depart, and then returned to the
cottage, discussing the events of the morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>They found Hans savagely at work cleaning the guns.
He was sweating and hurrying as if his life depended on
what he was doing. Browning was snoring on the bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, here, what are you doing?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gitting retty to met dot roppers!” shouted the Dutch
lad, fiercely ramming a swab stick down the barrel of a
gun. “You shust let dot roppers come fooling arount
here some more und seen how kvick he vill shoot me.
Oh, I peen goin’ to gatch heem und got der fife hundret
tollars!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE CANOE RACE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>It was the week of the annual muster of the Grand
Army at Camp Benson, on Lake Sebasticook. Every
cottage was occupied and a large number of tents were
pitched. Gray-headed veterans, heroes of the war, had
gathered there from all over the State of Maine. Every
day there were parades, a band concert, and a dance in
the large hall that had been built for that purpose. The
cottages and tents were decorated with bunting and flags.
Yellow-eyed beans, baked in a “bean hole,” were on every
bill of fare. Excursion trains stopped at the little platform
station, bringing large numbers of visitors from
Pittsfield, Newport, Corinna, Dexter and other towns.
The lake steamer was making regular trips between the
camp and Newport, and crowds came to the grounds in
teams, on foot and on bicycles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each day in the afternoon there was a ball game and
other sports of a nature to interest all. The band played
“The Star-Spangled Banner,” “Marching Through Georgia,”
“Yankee Doodle,” and other patriotic airs. The old
vets got together and fought over the battles of long ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hundreds of young people flocked to the ground and
enjoyed the pleasures of the occasion. The country girls
were red-cheeked and pretty, and the country lads were
sturdy, manly-looking young fellows, such as make the
best soldiers when in time of trouble the country calls her
loyal sons to arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not a few fashionable people visited Camp Benson and
enjoyed themselves thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were not all countrymen there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell and his friends had heard there was “fun”
at Camp Benson, and that was one reason why they
stopped at Lake Sebasticook. They had not been able to
hire a cottage anywhere near the camp, and so they took
the one on Sandy Point, although it was several miles
away. Hearing there were to be canoe races at the camp,
Frank looked about to obtain some canoes, and he was
fortunate enough to secure four, although he was forced
to pay an exorbitant price for the use of them that week.
Three of them were single canoes, for racing purposes.
The fourth was the birch in which Merry and Hodge had
gone out fishing.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the following day Frank’s entire party was at Camp
Benson, for this afternoon the canoe races were to take
place. Merry, Hodge and Diamond had resolved to enter
the races.</p>

<p class='c010'>First, however, there was a sailing race, and this they
did not enter. They took pains to get into the following
race.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were nine starters, of which our friends made
three. Two were from Newport, one from Pittsfield, one
from Corinna, one from Foxcroft and one from Greenville,
on Moosehead Lake. It was generally believed that
the Greenville man would win, although it was said that
Jim Welch, of Newport, would give him a hot pull.</p>

<p class='c010'>The race was set to take place at three o’clock in the
afternoon, but it was twenty minutes later when all the
contestants lined up at the starting point.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shore of the lake was thronged with spectators,
and the band was playing a lively air near the dance hall,
the music floating over the water on the gentle breeze.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the lineup Merriwell and his friends had formed
together. They were stripped to trousers, shirts and
caps. Frank was laughing and joking, but Hodge and
Diamond looked grim and determined.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man from Greenville was a long-haired, weather-tanned
chap, with a hard, knotty arm and broad shoulders.
Certainly he did look like a formidable antagonist.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the contestants were inclined to guy Merry
and his friends. They cautioned them not to capsize,
asked them if they could swim, told them they might do
better to get out and push their canoes, and tried to have
sport with them generally.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond did not relish this sort of chaffing, and the
hot flush on his cheeks showed he was irritated. Hodge
held his anger down, while Frank seemed to regard it as
part of the fun.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of us must win this race!” grated the Virginian,
sullenly. “They take us for a lot of flubs. I paddled a
canoe almost as soon as I learned to walk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Keep cool,” cautioned Merry. “It won’t do any good
to get angry, and it may cause you to lose the race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can a fellow keep cool, when these chumps are
blowing their wind at him! I feel like punching a few
of them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind. If you win, it will make them feel
cheap enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Welch is in the line,” said Hodge, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wonder if he is any good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody said he’d be the one to give the Greenville
chap a hard pull.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then look out for him, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are bound to be in the van at the finish. He
may try some kind of a trick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I guess not. He won’t have a chance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fellows like him make chances.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are expecting too much from him. I think he’ll
keep his place. He recovered pretty quick from his
ducking this morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get ready!” exclaimed Diamond, poising his paddle;
“the starter is going to give the signal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was some further delay about getting all the
canoes in line, and then the starter stood up in his boat
and lifted his pistol in the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ready!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>The paddles were poised.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c010'>When the pistol spoke, they were off in a bunch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost immediately, however, Jack Diamond began to
forge ahead, fairly sending his canoe flying over the surface
of the lake. He handled his paddle with strength
and skill, and he proved a surprise at the very start.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a cheer from shore and the fluttering of
handkerchiefs and waving of hats. The band played its
liveliest air.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell paddled steadily and easily from the start,
keeping well up with the body of the contestants, but not
making any great effort to gain thus early in the race.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge worked steadily, but was not particularly graceful
in his movements. He was a stout, sturdy fellow, but
no one had picked him out as a possible winner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Greenville man paddled in a style that was the
poetry of motion, and sent his canoe darting along without
any apparent trouble. There seemed every reason
why he should be regarded as an almost certain victor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch showed his skill, and he did not let the man from
Greenville gain an inch on him. Early in the race he
regarded that man as his only dangerous rival; but there
was to come a time before long when he would see there
were others in the race.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank saw, at the very outset, that Diamond had allowed
his anger to get the better of his judgment, and he felt that
the Virginian could not hold out as he had started.</p>

<p class='c010'>When half of the course had been covered three of the
contestants were falling behind. Diamond still held the
lead, but now Welch began to press him, with the Greenville
man hot after Welch. Merriwell was fourth, although
but slightly in advance of Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Frank was surprised to discover that Bart
was at his side—was passing him. Hodge was putting in
his best work at that point, and the way he forged ahead
brought faint cheers from the shore. He overtook the
Greenville man, passed him, and then he and Welch raced
for the lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond began to fail. He had started out too hard,
and the strain was beginning to tell on him. He held the
lead as long as possible, but Welch and Hodge finally
passed him. Then he dropped behind the man from
Greenville.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jack found Merriwell at his side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get into it, Frank!” he panted. “I’m out! Can’t keep
it up! Push them, Merry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s time,” were the only words that came from Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steadily and surely he crept up on those in advance.
He passed the man from the Lake region, and then the
only ones ahead of him were Hodge and Welch.</p>

<p class='c010'>The end of the race was near, and Welch was leading
Bart by nearly half a length. It looked as if he was a
sure winner.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now Merriwell came up with amazing speed.
Soon he was pressing those in advance, and still he continued
to gain, although both Welch and Hodge seemed
straining every nerve.</p>

<p class='c010'>For one moment Welch glanced over his shoulder. He
saw Merriwell coming, with the Greenville man working
like a Trojan to hold close to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment Jim Welch began to realize that Merriwell
stood a good chance of winning. Welch knew that
he was doing his level best, and yet Frank was gaining.</p>

<p class='c010'>Anger flamed in the fellow’s heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He shan’t win!” he grated.</p>

<p class='c010'>He made a final spurt that carried him ahead of Hodge,
but still Merriwell came on. Welch saw that Frank
must pass him just before the end of the course was
reached. A determination seized upon him. He would
foul Merriwell. Hodge was behind and would be stopped
by them. That would give the race to the man from
Greenville.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having decided on this treacherous course, Welch was
not long in putting the plan into operation. Frank was
passing when, with a sharp swoop of the paddle, Welch
whirled his canoe to cut Merriwell off.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Bart Hodge was watching for that trick, and he had
reserved a certain amount of strength for the critical moment.
Now he seemed to cause his canoe to leap forward,
and its sharp prow struck the side of the one
Welch occupied, smashing it like an eggshell. A second
later Jim Welch was in the water, and Merriwell sped on
to victory, a sure winner at the last moment!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>AFTER THE RACE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>There was a faint cheer from the shore. Merriwell had
won the race, and the man from Greenville was second.
Welch had received a merited ducking, but was rescued
from the water without much trouble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Welch was furious. Over and over he declared he
would have won the race had not Hodge fouled him, but
the judges decided it was his own fault, as he was seen
to deliberately get in Bart’s way.</p>

<p class='c010'>This silenced him, but he looked sullen and revengeful,
and continued to mutter to himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The canoe occupied by Hodge had not been injured by
the collision, and Bart slowly paddled toward shore at
Merriwell’s side when the race was over.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what do you think about it now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I had the pull of my life to win,” admitted
Frank. “I came near waiting too long before getting
down to business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I felt that one of us stood a good show to win,”
said Bart; “but that was not what I meant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh? Then what did you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think about Mr. Jim Welch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he tried to foul me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you prevented it, although I don’t know how you
did it, for you were on the other side of him a few moments
before. I was paying attention strictly to business,
and supposed I was passing with Welch between us. How
did you get in there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you,” said Hodge, in a low tone. “I saw
you were coming up at wonderful speed, for I took the
chance of looking round. I realized that you would be a
winner if not interfered with, and that you were going to
pass on the other side of Welch. The moment I realized
that, into my mind flashed the conviction that he would
try to keep you from winning. The man from Greenville
was hanging close to you, and there was a chance that he
would beat all of us, unless you had a free course to the
finish. I felt that I had a slim show of winning, so I permitted
my canoe to drop back till I could cross behind
Welch just when you were forging alongside of him. I
reserved a certain amount of strength for a great spurt,
and I needed it the moment I got into position. When I
saw him try to foul you, I used every ounce of energy
and drove my canoe into his. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you did a good job, old man; but I don’t know
what the judges will say about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t care what they say about it. What I want to
know is what you say about Mr. Jim Welch now. Yesterday
he tried to hammer you, to-day he tried to shoot
you, and now, although you saved him from drowning
this morning, he did his best to knock you out of this race.
Is he thoroughly bad or not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a rascal, that I will admit, but I do not believe
him thoroughly bad, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you are hard to convince!” cried Hodge, in disgust.
“I think you are stubborn—you will not give up
when you know you are wrong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do not think that, Hodge,” said Merry, reproachfully;
“you must know better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Not another word would Bart say about it. He
paddled along in sulky silence, not even giving heed when
Frank thanked him for his act in preventing Welch from
fouling.</p>

<p class='c010'>From their boat the judges announced that Frank Merriwell
was the winner. When Welch protested, they told
him he deliberately turned his canoe in front of Hodge.
The fellow could have claimed that Bart was off his
course, but he was cautioned to let it drop, being told that
it would be better to do that, as his attempt at crooked
play would be shown up if he made a fuss about it. So
the report went out that the collision came about because
Welch got in Hodge’s course; but those who saw everything
plainly knew this was not the real cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>For two days Frank Merriwell had kept his identity
secret as far as possible, being led to do so because of his
experiences in Camden, Rockland and Belfast. Now,
however, everybody was asking the name of the winner,
and it passed from one to another that it was the great
Yale athlete, Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two baseball teams had watched the race from the
shore. They were the Newports and the M. C. I.’s, of
Pittsfield, and the most of them had heard of Merriwell.
When they knew he was there at Camp Benson they were
eager to get a close look at him. Hundreds of others experienced
the same eagerness, and thus it came about that
there was a rush of people toward that point of shore
that Frank approached.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some one proposed a cheer for Frank Merriwell, and
it was given with a hearty will. Then a man cried:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, he’s one of them Sandy Point dudes that everybody
said wouldn’t cut no ice in the race.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mebbe he didn’t cut no ice,” cried another, “but he
cut water enough to win first purse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This caused a laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were scores of pretty girls in the throng, and
they regarded the handsome victor admiringly. Merriwell
could have flirted with almost any of them had he
chosen, although he would have needed a proper introduction
to not a few before they would have recognized
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Camp Benson, however, there seemed to be an unusual
freedom, and it was not difficult to get acquainted
with almost anyone. Young ladies who would not have
thought of such impropriety elsewhere often ventured to
flirt mildly with strangers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bruce Browning was lounging in the shade beneath a
tree, with Dunnerwust at his side, awaiting Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Merry,” he called, “you did the trick, but I
had begun to think you were not in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yaw,” nodded Hans, “you hat pegun to think I vos
nod in id, but ven you got der sdart der odder veller on
I seen how der peesness peen goin’ to end. You vos a
lulu, Vrankie!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hans’ dialect caused those in his vicinity to smile or
laugh outright.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank came ashore, and immediately he was surrounded
by the ball players.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Merriwell,” said the captain of the Newport
team, “we would like to have you umpire the game for
us this afternoon. It begins right away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be a great favor, Mr. Merriwell,” declared the
captain of the M. C. I.’s, with more politeness. “I assure
you we shall regard it as a great favor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The position is not a pleasant one,” said Frank. “I’d
much rather look on and see the game.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will pay you if you——” began the Newport
captain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank stopped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You cannot hire me for money to umpire,” he said,
promptly. “If I did so——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you?” cried several.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go ahead, Merry,” said Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” laughed Frank, “I’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One minute later criers were running over the ground
announcing that the ball game that afternoon would be
umpired by the great Yale pitcher, Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was given time to change his clothes, and then,
still accompanied by Hodge, he went onto the ball ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ground was not fenced, and it was completely
surrounded by a throng of spectators. The M. C. I.’s
were practicing.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Frank appeared, somebody shouted:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here comes Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a great clapping of hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank was dressed in a spotless white flannel suit, and
he made a handsome appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The captains of the two teams approached him, and
he asked them about ground rules. They gave him the
desired information, and then he was provided with a
fresh Spaulding in an unbroken box.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Newports had practiced already, and the time for
the game to begin was past, so Merriwell stepped out behind
the plate and called:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Play ball!”</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>NEWPORT WINS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>It had been decided that the M. C. I.’s should take the
field, so they remained in their positions, and the game
began with a sharp two-bagger from Newport’s first
batter. To the astonishment of everybody, although he
had been behind the plate when the ball was hit, Frank
was down to second base ahead of the runner, standing
in just the proper position to see the play perfectly, and
he pronounced the man safe on a close play, a decision
that might have been disputed had he remained near the
plate. In fact, the second baseman opened his mouth to
dispute the ruling, but closed up immediately on seeing
that Frank was not more than ten feet away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then followed an exhibition of umpiring such as no
one present had ever witnessed before. Frank was all
over the diamond, and he always seemed on exactly the
best spot to see any play to advantage. How he covered
so much ground was a mystery, but he did it without
seeming to exert himself remarkably, and he kept the
game hustling from the very start.</p>

<p class='c010'>Newport scored twice in their half of the first inning,
and were prevented from making a third tally by a
beautiful throw from deep left to the plate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Newport went into the field. They filled the
box with Burton, of Corinna, a Colby man, and a puzzling
“south-paw” pitcher. Burton’s greatest fault was
his slow delivery, but, being in good form, he more than
made up for it by his tricks in “working the batter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Newport had not beaten the Institute team in two years,
and the M. C. I.’s fancied they had a snap. They had
been against Burton before, and hit him pretty hard, and
they believed they could do it again. But Burton, who
was a determined chap, with a bulldog disposition to never
give up, was there to redeem himself that day. He proceeded
to strike out the first two men with great ease, and
then he caused the third man to pop up a light fly that he
gathered himself without getting out of his tracks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Institute boys laughed at this.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll fall on him and hammer him out of the box the
next inning,” they said.</p>

<p class='c010'>But they did not, for neither side scored in the following
inning. There were, however, three close plays, one at
second, one at third, and one at the home plate. Frank
Merriwell was on hand to witness every play from the
most advantageous point and his decisions could not be
disputed with reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both players and spectators began to see that the umpiring
was making it a remarkably lively and interesting
game at the very start off.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the fourth inning the M. C. I. team tied the score,
and in the fifth it took a lead of three.</p>

<p class='c010'>Newport had not been able to score thus far after
the first, and the Institute lads declared it was “all over
but the shouting.” That did not disturb Burton, who continued
to work in the same cool, deliberate manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the seventh inning Newport got a tally, but M. C. I.
made two more, giving them a lead of four.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the eighth Newport cut it down by two in their half,
and then Burton “pitched for his life.” In vain the Institute
lads tried to get a safe hit off him. One man
fanned and the others were “killed at first.” As both of
these decisions were close, a M. C. I. player started a
vigorous kick on the last one, but Frank, who had made
every ruling promptly and firmly, quickly closed the kicker
up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came the “fatal ninth.” Newport needed two to
tie and three to win. If they made three and white-washed
their opponents the game was theirs.</p>

<p class='c010'>They started in by getting two men out in a hurry, and
the boys from Pittsfield were laughing over the “snap.”
Then a weak hit landed a runner on first. The next man
was not a heavy hitter, and so, instead of trying to stop
the runner, the pitcher attempted to end it by striking the
batter out. That gave the man on first a chance to steal
second without danger, and he did so. Then the batter
rapped out a light one that was fumbled, and crossed first
ahead of the ball.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burton came to the plate. He had been hitting poorly,
but now there was a look of grim determination on his
dark face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get old ‘south-paw,’ Winnie,” called one of the players
to the pitcher.</p>

<p class='c010'>The twirler grinned and nodded. He was confident,
for he had been fooling Burton all day on a slow drop.
To start off, he sent a straight whistler over the plate so
near to the batter that Burton was forced to jump back.
Then the pitcher fancied he had his man unnerved. The
spectators were shouting and cheering, trying to rattle
both pitcher and batter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second ball was a slow drop. Burton waited for
it, got under it, hit it, lifted it into the air with awful
force. Away it flew over the ground and down among
the cottages, and, when last seen, it was bounding merrily
among the trees, making for the lake, which showed blue
in the distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Round the bases sped the runners, and three scores
came in before the ball was overtaken and returned. It
was a “homer” for Burton, and he had placed Newport
one score in the lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The crowd cheered itself hoarse, and the boys from
Pittsfield looked disgusted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next batter sent up an easy one for the shortstop,
and Newport was out.</p>

<p class='c010'>The M. C. I.’s came in growling. They were determined
to win the game by hard batting in the ninth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get onto Burton, fellows,” said the captain. “We
must do it right here. We can if we try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They did try, but Burton was doing great work just
about that time. He had won the game by his hit, and
now he did not propose to lose it by his work in the box.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bases filled up, however, with only one man out.
A good hit meant two runs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came two decisions on a rattling double play, and
Merriwell got both of them right by swift work. Both
were declared out, and the game was over—Newport had
won!</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the Institute men started to growl, but the captain
cut them off sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was the best umpiring I ever saw!” he exclaimed,
enthusiastically. “Mr. Merriwell, we owe you our thanks.
You did a beautiful job, and I believe you made this game
one of the best ever played on this ground. There were
any amount of close decisions, and I think you had all
of them right. Newport beat us to-day, but I am not raising
a growl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook hands with Frank, and the Newport captain
came up and did the same. The pitchers of both teams
stated that never before had they been so well satisfied
concerning the rules on balls and strikes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Newport captain proposed three cheers for the
M. C. I.’s, which were given. Then he proposed three
more for the umpire, and there was an almost universal
response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said Hodge, coming up to Frank, “that was a
better game than I expected to see here, but I know your
work had something to do with it. Poor umpiring would
have set half these fellows kicking, and ruined the game.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s new work for me,” laughed Frank; “and I am
not particularly stuck on it. Now, I’m hungry enough
to eat anything. I want some of those ‘army beans.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yaw,” grunted Hans, waddling up, “I vos so hongry
dot you can veel id at der bit uf my stomachs. Id vos
awful ven you felt all gone ad der bit uf my stomachs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are Browning and Diamond?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know,” answered Bart. “Think they must be
taking in the dance. I reckon we’ll find them there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we’ll go down to the hall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On their way, however, Browning was seen coming
toward them hurriedly, much to the astonishment of all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s really hurrying!” exclaimed Frank. “What does
it mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something is up,” declared Hodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something has gone wrong! Diamond isn’t with
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bruce came up, breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on, fellows!” he exclaimed. “We are needed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up the shore.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter? Diamond in trouble?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet, but he is in the toughest sort of a crowd, and
I knew I would have no influence to get him out of it.
That’s why I came for you, Merriwell. He will do as
you say.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>A “SKIN GAME.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>“What sort of a crowd is Diamond in?” asked Merriwell,
somewhat puzzled by the big Yale man’s words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A poker gang.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! that’s it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did he get into it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know. I saw him talking with two fellows, and
then they walked away, and he went with them. Something
made me follow them, and that’s the way I got onto
it. You know there is nothing Jack had rather do than
play poker.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he quit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At college, yes; you induced him to do that. That’s
why I came for you now. I might have waded into the
whole crowd and taken him out by force. Was tempted
to do it, but my reason told me it was not a good plan.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange to me that he should play poker with
strangers. It’s not like Jack.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I suppose he thought he might as well have some
sport while he was away down here, and I don’t believe
he is looking for sharpers in this part of the country.
It’s more likely he thinks himself as sharp as these people.
Besides that, they are playing a very small game.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How small?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Five-cent ante, twenty-five limit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I have seen a man lose ten or fifteen dollars
at that. He can lose more if he is playing against crooks.
But what made you think Diamond is in a gang of
sharpers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Jim Welch is playing with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Jack Diamond is playing at the table with Jim
Welch? Well, this is a surprise! I can hardly believe
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hodge was not saying anything now, but he did not
miss a word. He was no less astonished than Merriwell
to learn that Jack was playing with Welch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Vait!” gurgled Hans, who was getting out of breath.
“You can’t kept oop mit me uf I hurry so, can I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better keep back, anyway,” said Bruce.
“They will hear you if you come lumbering up to the
cottage they are in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who toldt you so?” squawked the Dutch boy. “How
vos id I knew so much apout your pusiness? You make
me haf dot tired veelings, Misder Prowning!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bruce is right,” said Frank. “You had better keep
back, Hans. There may be a fight, and you will get in the
way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A vight!” gasped Hans. “Oxcuse me! I vos nod a
scrappers! I vill sot down und vait dill you got pack
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he proceeded to sit down at the foot of a tree,
leaning against it. The others hurried on. They left
Camp Benson and continued up the shore to a small
cove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is the cottage,” said Bruce, pointing out one
that stood back by itself amid the trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks deserted,” observed Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is because they have closed the door, and put
the shutters to the windows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how are we to look in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know a way. Come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They followed him round behind the cottage, and then
approached it with great caution, stepping lightly, so that
they would not be heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they came near, they could hear a humming of voices
within. They crept up to the back of the cottage, which
was not shingled on that end, and Browning applied his
eye to a knot hole. After a moment he drew back, showing
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t guess who is trying to get into the game
now?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look and see,” said Bruce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry did so. Applying his eye to the knot hole, he
was able to look into the cottage. He also could hear
the talk of the men around the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six of them were seated, Diamond and Welch being
two of the party. Another man, evidently a late comer,
was standing. He it was who was trying to get into the
game.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Bill Bunker!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why can’t I come in?” he was demanding, in a half-drunken
manner. “Mr. Welch will speak for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Welch, “he is a friend of mine, and he is all
right, gentlemen. I will speak for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It makes too many players at one table,” said one,
who seemed to be something of a stranger to the others.
“We have enough here now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He isn’t one of the gang,” thought Frank, immediately.
“He and Jack are the birds they are plucking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do the others object?” demanded Bunker, aggressively.
“Look here; I’ve got money to burn, and I’m
looking for an open grate to burn it in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he took out a roll of bills with one hand and
jingled some bright yellow pieces with the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gold!” exclaimed a player. “Where did you get so
much of that stuff? Gold isn’t plenty in these parts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’ve got this, and you may have it—if you can
win it,” said Bunker, with drunken swagger. “Shall I
come in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you say, Mr. Diamond?” asked Welch, speaking
to Jack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dunno’s I care a rap,” said the Virginian, thickly.
“His money’s good’s anybody’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank started, astounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Diamond has been drinking!” was his first thought.
“By Jove! the fellow is half drunk!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing could have astonished Merriwell more, for
Diamond was not a hard drinker; in fact, was not a
steady drinker, although he sometimes took a little beer
or wine. Now, however, he was somewhat intoxicated,
which explained how he happened to be playing poker
with a lot of strangers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was growing dark. Welch got up and lighted a
lamp within the cottage, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think there is any real objection to letting you
into the game, Mr. Bunker; but the size of it may not
suit you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the limit?” asked Bunker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A dollar—ten cents ante.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was another surprise for Frank. It was evident
the limit and the ante had been raised since Browning
left.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Five dollars would be better,” said Bunker. “Let’s
make it that. Tell you I’ve got money to burn. You
fellers may as well have some of it for kindling. What
say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have a drink all round,” said Welch, producing
a bottle and glasses.</p>

<p class='c010'>The drinks were poured and taken, and then, after a
brief discussion, it was decided to raise the limit to five
dollars and let Bunker into the game. The fellow who
had raised the first objection stood out the longest, but
he finally gave in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond lighted a cigar. He had a pile of money before
him, as they were not playing with chips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon the game was running again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Back of the cottage a brief consultation was held by
Jack’s three friends, and then Merriwell again peered
through the knot hole. He quickly grew interested, for
a large jack pot was on the table, and there was brisk
betting before the draw. Four of the seven remained
“in.” They were the stranger who had objected to
Bunker, Diamond, Welch and Bunker himself. Bunker
was dealing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank watched every move, and he quickly detected
the fact that Bunker was “clever.” The man was holding
back the top cards as the proper ones came up, and
he gave three thus held back to Welch, who was drawing
to a pair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is enough!” whispered Merriwell, grimly, as he
drew back. “It’s a skin game! We must get in before
this hand is played out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Round the cottage to the door they went.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We won’t stop to knock,” said Browning. “Stand
aside!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a rush, he hurled himself against the door, which
flew open with a smash and a slam.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the room went the big college man, followed by
Merriwell and Hodge. The front room was empty. As
Bruce paused a moment, Frank sprang past him, crying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rushed into the back room, where the game was
taking place.</p>

<p class='c010'>The gamblers were hastily rising to their feet and gathering
up their money, thinking they were raided by officers.
They were filled with consternation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the room came Merriwell, Browning and Hodge.
Frank was at Jack Diamond’s side in a moment. He
spoke swiftly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re in a skin game, old man! There’s a job to rob
you here! I’ve seen proof of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Virginian was somewhat bewildered by the sudden
and unexpected appearance of his friends. He did not
move, but Frank gathered up the money before him,
scooping it off the board in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The card players were amazed when they saw a lot of
beardless young fellows come in upon them. At first they
did not understand what it meant, but Welch quickly took
in the situation. He saw that Diamond’s friends had followed
him there to save him from the trap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These are not officers!” he shouted. “They have no
right in here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No!” cried Bunker, furiously. “They broke in without
right! Give them blazes! Punch them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try it!” growled the big Yale man, squaring his shoulders
and lifting his “dukes.” “It will be sport!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At them!” howled Welch.</p>

<p class='c010'>He leaped forward, but Browning reached out a hand
and seemed to catch the fellow in mid air. With a swing,
he flung Welch fairly across the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come up, gentlemen!” he thundered. “I’ll take care
of the whole of you if you walk up one at a time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the gamblers caught up a chair and flung it at
the head of the big man. Bruce did not dodge, but he
caught the chair and flung it back promptly, knocking the
fellow down.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time Merriwell had succeeded in pulling Diamond
to his feet, and he was trying to impress the Virginian
with a sense of the situation. Jack started to protest
that he was all right and had not needed assistance,
but just then one of the gamblers tried to hit Frank. Diamond
saw the movement, and that, more than anything
else, awakened him. Like a flash, he whirled and let the
fellow have it with his left, striking him under the ear.
It was a savage blow, and it knocked Merriwell’s would-be
assailant spinning into a corner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t try to strike a friend of mine!” rang out the
Virginian’s voice, now clear as a bell. “You can’t do
that while I am around!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At them!” snarled Bunker. “Knock ’em out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there was a general charge on Merriwell and his
friends. The gamblers caught up any kind of a weapon
and started in to lay out the intruders in short order.</p>

<p class='c010'>But they had started in on a hard job, as they were
soon to discover, for the four Yale men were fighters.
Now that he was aroused, there was nothing slow about
Browning’s movements, and he actually enjoyed the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the next five minutes there was a pitched battle
in that room, and a savage one at that. At the outset, the
gamblers fought furiously, and some of the intruders
were not to escape without small injuries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank Merriwell singled out Bunker, who had caught
up a stick of wood and was trying to get a crack at
Browning that would lay the big man out. Merry lit
on the ruffian and wrenched the club from his hand, at the
same time giving him a jab that sent him reeling up
against the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker turned, snarling like a wounded animal. With
a leap he was upon Frank, and he attempted to crush
Merriwell down with the fury of his assault.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he had struck a lad who would not be crushed so
easily. Frank met his rush, grappled with him, gave him
a wrestler’s trip and hurled the man over his hip.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker shook the cottage when he fell, but he was up
again quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll fix you!” he grated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on,” was his invitation. “You don’t seem to
be doing very well so far.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they met again, but this time Frank dodged and
gave the man a body blow that brought a grunt from
his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker was a fighter, and he was not awkward in his
movements, although he was astonished by the work of
the lad he had expected to knock out so easily. He
whirled again, and this time he struck so quickly that
Merry was hit a glancing blow on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s not so bad,” admitted Frank, cheerfully. “Come
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker accepted the invitation, but the blow was
parried and returned with interest. Then there was some
“in-fighting” that would have set a crowd of spectators
wild had it been at a boxing match. Merry was rapped
several times before he got in another good one, but he
got it in at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>Panting, Bunker dropped to his knees. He did not go
down, however, but made a forward plunge in rising,
trying to come up under Frank’s guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merry leaped back, and so was not caught about the
body and lifted, that being the trick Bunker had attempted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning’s heavy voice was heard urging the whole
crowd to “come and see him.” Now and then he would
grab a man and fling him bodily through the air. Thus
it happened that he threw one of them against Frank, and
Merriwell was knocked flat upon the floor. Bunker
fancied he saw his opportunity, and he leaped up with the
intention of planting both heels in Frank’s face. It was
a wicked, almost murderous, attempt, but it did not
succeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning saw him, and, being within reach at that
moment, thrust out a hand, caught him in mid air before
he could drop on Frank, and gave him a fling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning’s wonderful strength saved Frank Merriwell
from disfigurement for life, possibly from a fatal injury.
Bunker was hurled across the room, and Merry leaped up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good trick, old man!” he exclaimed, appreciatingly.
“Dead lucky for me that you did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond and Hodge were doing their level best, and
now there was a bellowing sound in the other room, and
Hans Dunnerwust, armed with two clubs, one in each
hand, came plunging in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oxcuse me!” he cried. “Berhaps you vant me to lick
myseluf! Vale, I vos a vighter from Vighterville!
Whoop! Shoost seen how I got der game indo! I pet
der whole crowdt vill lick me pefore der vun is ofer!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he lay about him blindly with those clubs, being
nearly as dangerous to his friends as to his foes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning caught Hans by the collar and a convenient
part of his trousers, and flung him out into the other room,
closing the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There!” grunted the big fellow; “now we will proceed
with the festivities. Let the band play on!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The gamblers were astounded, for they were beginning
to believe that the intruders all enjoyed fighting. Many
of the rascals were bruised and bleeding, and they were
beginning to weaken. Welch urged them on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker waded into it again, and, aided by Welch, he
led the gang to another assault.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank singled out the man who had tried to stamp
upon him. He forced his way toward Bunker, reached
him, went at him again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are the one I am looking after?” he cried. “I have
a score to settle with you, and I am going to settle it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they went at it again, but now Merriwell showed
himself the man’s superior. He hit Bunker repeatedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of his blows brought about a remarkable result.
The beard on Bunker’s face was knocked away and nearly
came off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s false!” thought Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment the hanging lamp came down with a
crash and went out, leaving the room in absolute darkness.
Browning caught hold of Merriwell and Diamond
and forced them out through the door, Hodge following
instantly. All four rushed out to the open air, where
Hans Dunnerwust joined them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all over,” said Frank. “Let’s get away quickly.
This row will bring a crowd to this spot, for it must have
been heard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now it was quite dark in the woods, and they hastened
away into the thick shadows.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>FRANK’S CAPTURE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The following morning the campers on Sandy Point
were astir at an early hour. Browning did not carry a
mark of the conflict, but Merriwell and Hodge showed
slight bruises.</p>

<p class='c010'>Diamond was thoroughly ashamed of having been found
in such a gang. Naturally distant toward strangers, it
was difficult for him to explain how he had been led into
the trap. Seeing this, Frank did not press him for an
explanation. The real truth was, however, that, overcome
by mortification because of the poor showing he had made
in the canoe race, the Virginian had decided to take a
drink. Being in a prohibition State, he had found it
difficult to obtain anything. However, he had found an
individual who claimed to know where there was something,
and Jack had been led to the cottage up the shore.
After taking two or three drinks, the Virginian did not
notice that the party that gathered was composed of
persons who seemed to have a secret understanding, one
with another. Jack was looking for excitement, and a
game of poker promised to provide what he sought. Thus
he was drawn into the game. After it began Welch appeared
and was taken in. Then came Bunker. The
reader knows what followed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dunnerwust turned out early and built a fire. Then he
wandered away from the cottage, going out to the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty minutes later, he came panting and stumbling
into the cottage, showing symptoms of great excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kvick!” he gurgled. “Somepody gone oudt und
drife him avay!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter, Hans?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He vill got avay uf you don’d hurry oop!” spluttered
the Dutch boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who will get away? What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Der man mit der viskers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What man?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Der one vot seen me ad der gottage vere der vight
peen last nighd. I shust seen him oudt here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The man with the whiskers?” repeated Frank. “There
was but one man with whiskers at the cottage last night.
That was Bunker. He can’t be here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yaw; he vos oudt there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he is up to some crookedness!” exclaimed Merry,
leaping to his feet and catching up a shotgun. “Where
is he, Hans?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oudt towart der ganoes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank sprang through the doorway, and Diamond followed.
Seeing this, Hans ran after them, directing them
by shouting loudly, much to Merriwell’s disgust.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If there’s anybody out here, he’ll know we are coming,”
thought Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>Straight out toward the beach on which the canoes lay
Frank ran. He was not long in coming in sight of the
shore. When he did so, he saw something that made his
blood leap in his veins.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Bunker was pushing off from the shore in one of
the single canoes. The man could hear the voice of Hans,
and it was plain he knew some one was coming, for he
started to paddle away as swiftly as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank broke out of the woods and ran down to the
very water’s edge. Then he threw the gun to his shoulder
and took aim toward the man in the canoe, shouting:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop! Come back here, or I will shoot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker cast a look over his shoulder and saw Merriwell.
He hesitated, with the paddle poised in the air. It was
plain that he was in doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean business!” declared Frank. “You are stealing
one of our canoes, and I shall be justified in shooting you.
As true as there is a gun in my hand, I’ll shoot if you
do not turn about at once and paddle back here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>No one could doubt his earnestness. Bunker did not
hesitate longer, but promptly turned about and sullenly
paddled to the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What were you doing with that canoe?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said the man, “I did mean to take all of them
as payment for the guns you lost for Welch and I yesterday
morning, but I heard you coming before I was
ready to take them in tow. You will have to pay for
those guns before I am done with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So that was your trick? Well, it was just what I
should expect from you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I don’t know as I want your old canoes, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker turned to walk away, but Frank stopped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so fast,” said Merry, grimly. “I am not through
with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Frank covered the man with the muzzle of the
shotgun.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up with your hands!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker turned pale.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I command you to put them up. Be lively
about it! I know I am dealing with a desperado, and I
shall not hesitate to shoot if you try to fool with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man tried to palaver, but that did not go with
Frank, and he was forced to obey. He held his hands
above his head, and then Merry directed Diamond to
search and disarm him. This Jack did, taking a revolver
and knife from the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following this, the painter was taken from one of the
canoes, and the man’s hands were bound behind his back,
despite his protestations and threats. Then he was
marched to the cottage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Browning and Hodge were just coming out to see what
was going on when the trio appeared with the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was stealing one of our canoes,” explained Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what are you going to do with him?” asked
Bruce.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know yet. I’ll decide on that point later.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bunker was marched into the cottage, and then Frank
observed:</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is one little point I mean to settle without delay.
There is a certain mystery about this gentleman.
If I am not mistaken, it does not require a razor to give
him a clean shave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he took hold of the captive’s whiskers and gave
them a sharp jerk. They came off in his hands, showing
they were false.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just what I thought!” exclaimed Merry, triumphantly.
“Now, how about this long hair?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It did not take long to establish the fact that Bunker
wore a wig and his face was stained with paint that made
it look coarse and repulsive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fellows,” cried Merriwell, “see that scar under his
ear! I have made a big catch this morning, for this is
the gentleman Ben Bowers, the sheriff, wants to see. This
is Joe Tweed, who robbed and nearly killed Peter Small!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Frank’s words gave the others a shock, but they saw
that, with his disguise removed, the man answered the
description Bowers had given of the robber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course the captive denied that he was Tweed, but
that made no difference with Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Bowers will decide that point,” he said. “I shall
take you over to see him to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The prisoner resorted to threats, pleading and attempted
bribery. Everything was unavailing. Frank was determined,
and that very day, before noon, the man stood before
the sheriff and was identified as Joe Tweed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Young man,” said Bowers, “you done a big job when
you caught him! The reward is your’n, and I’ll see that
you git it. I was afraid the blamed critter had got clean
away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And so I would,” said Tweed, sullenly, “if I had not
been a fool. I might have skipped yesterday, but I stayed
to get a crack at Frank Merriwell, and he has landed me
here. I made my mistake in not letting him rip, even
if he was responsible for my ducking in the lake. But I
never robbed old Small, and I defy you to prove that I
did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This did not prove so hard, however, for Jim Welch
turned out to be Tweed’s accomplice, and he gave the
whole thing away when he was accused. Almost every
dollar of the stolen money was recovered, and both Welch
and Tweed were indicted and held for trial.</p>

<p class='c010'>Merriwell actually received the reward that had been
offered for the capture of the robber.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fellows,” he said, “that was a great catch, for this
money will go a long distance toward defraying the expenses
of our trip. We are having lots of sport, and it
is not costing us much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you must acknowledge one thing,” said Hodge,
with a show of triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you failed to find a redeeming quality in one
rascal, and that one was Jim Welch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” laughed Frank, “Welch did not turn out very
well, but still I do not believe he is all bad. He has not
been given much of a show to exhibit the better side of his
nature.”</p>
